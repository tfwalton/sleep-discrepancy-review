In order to identify the level of agreement between different methods, we compared sleep parameters derived from single-channel EEG (scEEG), actigraphy, and sleep diaries in cognitively normal and mildly impaired older adults. Methods: Two hundred ninety-three participants were monitored at home for up to six nights with scEEG, actigraphy, and sleep diaries. Total sleep time (TST), sleep efficiency (SE), sleep onset latency (SOL), and wake after sleep onset (WASO) were calculated using each of these methods. In 109 of the 293 participants, the ratio of cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of phosphorylated tau (p-tau) and amyloid-Î²-42 (AÎ²42) was used as a biomarker for AD pathology. Results: Agreement was highest for TST across instruments, especially in cognitively normal older adults. Overall, scEEG and actigraphy appeared to have greater agreement for multiple sleep parameters than for scEEG and diary or actigraphy and diary. Levels of agreement between scEEG and actigraphy overall decreased in mildly impaired participants and those with biomarker evidence of AD pathology, especially for measurements of TST. Conclusions: Caution should be exercised when comparing scEEG and actigraphy in individuals with mild cognitive impairment or with AD pathology. Sleep diaries may capture different aspects of sleep compared to scEEG and actigraphy. Additional studies comparing different methods of measuring sleep-wake activity in older adults are necessary to allow for comparison between studies using different methods.","Accession Number: 151811860.

E-mail: l.w.a.hermans@tue.nl","Objectives: To extend and validate a previously suggested model of the influence of uninterrupted sleep bouts on sleep onset misperception in a large independent data set. Method(s): Polysomnograms and sleep diaries of 139 insomnia patients and 92 controls were included. We modeled subjective sleep onset as the start of the first uninterrupted sleep fragment longer than Ls minutes, where parameter Ls reflects the minimum length of a sleep fragment required to be perceived as sleep. We compared the so-defined sleep onset latency (SOL) for various values of Ls. Model parameters were compared between groups, and across insomnia subgroups with respect to sleep onset misperception, medication use, age, and sex. Next, we extended the model to incorporate the length of wake fragments. Model performance was assessed by calculating root mean square errors (RMSEs) of the difference between estimated and perceived SOL. Result(s): Participants with insomnia needed a median of 34 minutes of undisturbed sleep to perceive sleep onset, while healthy controls needed 22 minutes (Mann-Whitney U = 4426, p < 0.001). Similar statistically significant differences were found between sleep onset misperceivers and non-misperceivers (median 40 vs. 20 minutes, Mann-Whitney U = 984.5, p < 0.001). Model outcomes were similar across other subgroups. Extended models including wake bout lengths resulted in only marginal improvements of model outcome. Conclusion(s): Patients with insomnia, particularly sleep misperceivers, need larger continuous sleep bouts to perceive sleep onset. The modeling approach yields a parameter for which we coin the term Sleep Fragment Perception Index, providing a useful measure to further characterize sleep state misperception.Copyright Â© Sleep Research Society 2020.

The present study aimed to assess the effect of cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia on subjective and objective sleep discrepancy of total sleep time, sleep-onset latency and wake after sleep onset. The total sleep time discrepancy was also assessed across the entire therapy. The second aim was to examine the treatment outcome of two insomnia groups differing in sleep perception. Thirty-six adults with insomnia (mean ageÂ =Â 46.7â€…years, SDÂ =Â 13.9; 22 females) were enrolled in the final analyses. Patients underwent a 6-week group cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia programme. Sleep diary and actigraphy measurements were obtained during the therapy. Patients who underestimated total sleep time (nÂ =Â 16; underestimating group) were compared with patients who accurately perceived or overestimated total sleep time (nÂ =Â 20; accurate/overestimating group). After cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia, a significant decrease of total sleep time and sleep-onset latency discrepancy was observed without a change in wake after sleep onset discrepancy in the total sample. Only the underestimating group reported decreased sleep-onset latency discrepancy after the treatment, whereas total sleep time discrepancy significantly changed in both groups. The underestimating group showed a significant decrease of total sleep time discrepancy from Week 1 to Week 2 when the sleep restriction was implemented, whereas the accurate/overestimating group showed the first significant change at Week 4.

But, undergraduate students often report engaging in short, irregular, and poor-quality sleep. Anecdotal and questionnaire data suggest that poor sleep habits might be prevalent in students who are in studio- or project-based majors that implicitly encourage consecutive nights of disrupted sleep to complete projects. We investigated sleep quantity and quality using both objective measures (wristband actigraphy monitoring) and subjective measures (sleep diary) in 28 interior design undergraduate students for a 7-day period. Our primary aim was to measure sleep quantity (total sleep time) and quality (e.g., nighttime awakenings) and to compare whether undergraduate interior design students' objective measures of sleep (actigraphy) differed from their subjective measures (sleep diary). The secondary aim was to investigate detrimental outcomes of poor sleep habits on laboratory-based measures of cognitive function (symmetry span, prospective memory, Raven's progressive matrices, remote associates task) that were administered pre- and poststudy. We found that the interior design students in our study overestimated their total sleep time by 36 minutes, that 79% of students slept for fewer than 7 hours at least three nights per week, and that many students cycled between nights of restricted/short sleep and recovery/long sleep. Importantly, students who maintained short sleep durations, highly variable night-to-night sleep durations, or had fragmented sleep (i.e., waking after sleep onset) demonstrated pre- to poststudy declines on the laboratory measure of creativity (remote associates task). These findings suggest the need for further investigations, which may lead to a broader discussion of studio culture and the role of the â€œall-nighter,â€ both in professional practice and in design education.

Although wrist actigraphy and self-report diaries are feasible alternatives to PSG, few studies have compared all three modalities concurrently across multiple nights in the home to assess their relative validity across multiple sleep outcomes. This study compared sleep duration and continuity measured by PSG, actigraphy, and sleep diaries and examined moderation by race/ethnicity., Methods: Participants from the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN) Sleep Study included 323 White (n = 147), African American (n = 120), and Chinese (n = 56) middle-aged community-dwelling women (mean age: 51 years, range: 48-57). PSG, wrist actigraphy (AW-64; Philips Respironics, McMurray, PA), and sleep diaries were collected concurrently in participants' homes over three consecutive nights. Multivariable repeated-measures linear models compared time in bed (TIB), total sleep time (TST), sleep efficiency (SE), sleep latency (SL), and wake after sleep onset (WASO) across modalities., Results: Actigraphy and PSG produced similar estimates of sleep duration and efficiency. Diaries yielded higher estimates of TIB, TST, and SE versus PSG and actigraphy, and lower estimates of SL and WASO versus PSG. Diary SL was shorter than PSG SL only among White women, and diary WASO was lower than PSG and actigraphy WASO among African American versus White women., Conclusions: Given concordance with PSG, actigraphy may be preferred as an alternative to PSG for measuring sleep in the home.

E-mail: Celyne.Bastien@psy.ulaval.ca","Individuals with insomnia present unique patterns of electroencephalographic (EEG) asymmetry between homologous regions of each brain hemisphere, yet few studies have assessed asymmetry within the same hemisphere. Increase in intrahemispheric asymmetry during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep in good sleepers (GS) and disruption of REM sleep in insomnia sufferers (INS) both point out that this activity may be involved in the pathology of insomnia. The objective of the present exploratory study was to evaluate and quantify patterns of fronto-central, fronto-parietal, fronto-occipital, centro-parietal, centro-occipital and parieto-occipital intrahemispheric asymmetry in GS and INS, and to assess their association with sleep-wake misperception, daytime anxiety and depressive symptoms, as well as insomnia severity. This paper provides secondary analysis of standard EEG recorded in 43 INS and 19 GS for three nights in a sleep laboratory. Asymmetry measures were based on EEG power spectral analysis within 0.3-60 Hz computed between pairs of regions at frontal, central, parietal and occipital derivations. Repeated-measures ANOVAs were performed to assess group differences. Exploratory correlations were then performed on asymmetry and sleep-wake misperception, as well as self-reported daytime anxiety and depressive symptoms, and insomnia severity. INS presented increased delta and theta F3/P3 asymmetry during REM sleep compared with GS, positively associated with depressive and insomnia complaints. INS also exhibited decreased centro-occipital (C3/O1, C4/O2) and parieto-occipital (P3-O1, P4/O2) theta asymmetry during REM. These findings suggest that INS present specific patterns of intrahemispheric asymmetry, partially related to their clinical symptoms. Future studies may investigate the extent to which asymmetry is related to sleep-wake misperception or memory impairments.Copyright Â© 2020 by the authors.

To examine the agreement between objective (accelerometer) and subjective measures of sleep in fibromyalgia women (FW) and healthy women (HW). To identify explanatory variables of the discrepancies between the objective and subjective measures in FW and in HW. Methods. 127 diagnosed FW and 53 HW filled the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) and wore the SenseWear Pro Armband (SWA) for 7 days in order to assess sleep over the last week. Participants completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) when the SWA was returned. Results. The SWA showed greater total duration (74 vs. 88 min/day) and average duration (7 vs. 9 min) of wake after sleep onset in FW compared with HW. The PSQI showed poorer sleep quality in all the variables studied in FW than in HW (all, p<0.001), except time in bed. There was a lack of intermethod agreement for total sleep time, sleep time without naps and sleep latency in FW. Age and educational status explained the inter-method mean difference in sleep time in FW. High discrepancy in sleep time between the SWA and the PSQI was related to higher FIQ scores (p<0.05). Conclusion. The objective measure only showed higher frequency and average duration of wake after sleep onset in FW compared with HW.

Participants reported their sleep retrospectively for the month before the recording night and on the recording night. On the recording night, they wore an Actiwatch-64 and were instructed to press the marker button upon getting into bed, each time they awoke, and at their final awakening. The post-traumatic stress disorder group reported much worse sleep than controls on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index for the previous month and somewhat poorer sleep on the recording night. However, on the recording night, neither diary nor actigraphic measures of number of awakenings, total time in bed, nor time lying awake after sleep onset differed between participants with and without post-traumatic stress disorder. Diary-reported number of awakenings was fewer than actigraphically captured awakenings.

Method(s): We retrospectively analysed 347 recordings (49% females, median age 48 years) of inpatient (n=258) and outpatient (n=89) PSG conducted between 2012 and 2016. Linear regression was applied to predict the discrepancy of objective and subjective sleep parameters (total sleep time, sleep efficiency, sleep latency), using age, gender, sleep disorder (hypersomnia, parasomnia, sleeprelated movement disorders, sleep-related breathing disorders), and PSG type (inpatient vs. outpatient) as regressors. Result(s): Sleep disorder was the best predictor of discrepancy between objective and subjective total sleep time (Beta=0.21, p=0.003) and sleep efficiency (Beta=0.25, p<0.001), independent of age and PSG type (p>0.05). Sleep efficiency showed a contributory effect of female gender (Beta=0.15, p=0.01). Patients with insomnia showed higher discrepancy of objective vs. subjective sleep parameters compared to all other patient groups (all p<0.05). Insomniac patients underestimated both total sleep time (median discrepancy: 46 minutes, p<0.001) and sleep efficiency (median discrepancy: 11%, p<0.001). No significant predictor for discrepancy of sleep latency was found. Conclusion(s): Misperception of sleep duration and efficiency is common in sleep lab patients, but found to be most prominent in patients suffering from insomnia, independent of age, gender, or inpatient vs. ambulatory recording setting. These findings challenge the concept of sole clinical diagnosis of insomnia, and highlight the significance of performing sleep recordings in insomniac patients.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,adult;central sleep apnea syndrome;conference abstract;controlled study;female;gender;hospital patient;human;hypersomnia;insomnia;linear regression analysis;major clinical study;male;middle aged;motor dysfunction;outpatient;parasomnia;*perception;polysomnography;retrospective study;*sleep latency;*sleep quality;sleep time;Sleep,,,trimmel_misperception_2021,The (Mis-)Perception of Sleep: Factors influencing the discrepancy of subjective vs. objective sleep parameters,"Trimmel et al., 2021",Austria,,,1,1,,,,,,patients with a range of sleep disorders who underwent laboratory or ambulatory PSG,individuals referred for PSG,adults,,,referred for PSG,,,n/a,n/a,303,PSG,1,1,,,,,,n/a,,,,,,,,n/a,n/a,n/a,,,,,,,,,R&K,"in-lab, home-based",nocturnal,"TST, SOL, SE",,,,standard,,first 3 consecutive epochs of stage 1 or first epoch of any other sleep (R&K),,,,TST/TIB*100,,,1,1,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,n/a,,,Selbstbeurteilungsbogens fur Schlafund Aufwachqualitat (SSA),Selbstbeurteilungsbogens fur Schlafund Aufwachqualitat (SSA),,,1,,,,,,,,1 night,1,matched,1,,,not reported,direct question,question,,,,,not reported,n/a,n/a,n/a,"sTST-oTST, sSOL-oSOL, sSE-oSE",1,dTST,dSOL,dSE,,,,,,,0,1,,,,,algebraic difference score,single night,,,1,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,n/a,wilcoxon signed rank test for paired samples for comparisons of parameters within patient groups,n/a,,,,,

While aspects of this difference may reflect measurement error, considerable portions of sleep discrepancy (SD) may be meaningful. Method(s): The current study explored SD in four groups of community dwelling older adults: good sleeping complainers, poor sleeping complainers, good sleeping non-complainers and poor sleeping non-complainers. Participants (N = 153, Mean age = 71.6) were screened for comorbid sleep disorders, completed demographic questions, BDI-II, and 14 consecutive nights of sleep diaries and actigraphy. Result(s): A MANCOVA [F(12,331.01) = 8.876, p < 0.001] controlling for gender, medical conditions, medications, and depression symptoms showed significant group differences on relative amounts of SOL [F(3,128) = 11.566, p < 0.001] and WASO [F(3,128) = 13.928, p < 0.001] SD and frequency of SOL [F(3,128) = 8.883, p < 0.001] and WASO SD [F(3,128) = 28.102, p < 0.001]. Greater amount and frequency of WASO SD (p's < 0.01) best separated poor sleeping complainers from the other groups. Among those with poor sleep (regardless of complaint), there was little difference in SOL SD (quantity or frequency). A multiple regression analysis predicting depressive symptoms showed an association between the quantity of SOL (beta = 0.39) and WASO (beta = 0.323) SD beyond medical and demographic factors [F(8,127) = 6.52, p < 0.001, r2 = 0.291]. Conclusion(s): These results suggest that older adults with poor sleep have heightened awareness of idle time in bed and that this impact is more pronounced in the middle of the night among individuals with a sleep complaint. Furthermore, these results suggest that the degree to which participants' self report of SOL and WASO exceeded actigraphy was associated with more depressive symptoms. The concurrent patterns of sleep discrepancy and depressive symptoms may be linked through the effects of cognitive hyperarousal, which has been independently suggested as an explanation for depression, sleep discrepancy and insomnia.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,*sleep;*organization;*adult;depression;human;insomnia;actimetry;night;implantable cardioverter defibrillator;self report;measurement error;sleep disorder;community;multiple regression;drug therapy;gender;multivariate analysis of covariance;Sleep,,,williams_sleep_2013,"Sleep discrepancy, sleep complaint, and poor sleep among older adults","Williams et al., 2011",USA,,,,1,,,,,,community-dwelling older adults,older adults,older adults,,,normative,,,n/a,n/a,142,Actigraphy,,,1,1,,,,Actiwatch-L,,,Actiware (not reported),,,,,Actiware-Sleep vol. 3.3,Actiware-Sleep,not reported,,,,,,,1,,n/a,n/a,,"SOL, WASO",,,,,,actigraphy-defined,,,,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,n/a,,,sleep diary,generic,1,,,,,,,,,,14 nights,14,matched,1,,,n/a,n/a,,,,,,n/a,direct question,direct question,direct question,"sSOL-oSOLo, sWASO-oWASO",1,dSOL,dWASO,,,,,,,,0,1,,,,,Algebraic difference score,mean discrepancy values,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,n/a,n/a,"frequency variable: number of nights SOL, WASO discrepancy was present",,,,,

Method(s): This is a cross-sectional study. Men and women who met inclusion criteria were recruited for this study. The inclusion criteria were apparently healthy Omani nationals ages 19 to 50 years. Sleep questionnaires were randomly distributed in Muscat either directly or via electronic and paper announcements. Data were collected from the participants using the self-reported questionnaires with four piloted questions for sleep pattern identification and through the actigraphy wristband given to subjects to wear for a week. Cohen's kappa test was performed for agreement analysis. Result(s): A total of 964 Omani subjects between ages 18 and 59 years of both genders were recruited and completed the questionnaires successfully. Out of these, only 321 subjects wore the actigraphy wristband for 1 week (response rate = 33%). Agreement analysis reported a mild level of agreement for the monophasic (41%), moderate level for biphasic (59%), and good level for polyphasic (70%) sleep patterns. The overall agreement level of sleep patterns between the two methods was 57%. There is a low specificity of self-reported assessment in reporting sleep pattern. Conclusion(s): The average agreement level of subjective versus objective assessments of sleep patterns was moderate at 57% and self-reported sleep pattern is not specific.

Objective parameters of sleep quality amongst rotator cuff tear patients are scarce in the literature. The aim of this study is to compare objective sleep data to historical controls and to subjective patient-reported sleep quality in patients with rotator cuff tears. Hypothesis: We hypothesized that patients with rotator cuff tears would demonstrate objectively poor sleep quality based on actigraphy when compared to a historical control group. Secondarily, we hypothesize that objective sleep quality measures will correlate poorly with traditionally used questionnaires and other subjective assessments. Material(s) and Method(s): Twenty patients with full-thickness rotator cuff tears wore a highly validated activity monitor for 2 consecutive weeks for objective assessment and completed a sleep diary during the same period. Patients completed multiple questionnaires pertaining to their shoulder function and subjective assessment of sleep quality. Objective sleep assessments were compared to patients' sleep diary data and to subjective sleep data from a historical cohort of 969 healthy adults aged 57-97 years. Result(s): Mean total sleep time, sleep onset latency, wake after sleep onset (WASO), and sleep efficiency were all significantly worse in the study cohort compared to the historical cohort (p = 0.0338, p = 0.0040, p < 0.0001, and p = 0.0474, respectively). Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) scores did not correlate with sleep efficiency (r = 0.3143, p = 0.2040) or WASO (r = -0.3068, p = 0.2153). Visual analog scale scores correlated with PSQI scores (r = 0.5260, p = 0.0249) and Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores (r = 0.4863, p = 0.0407). Patients tended to overreport their time spent asleep via a sleep diary compared to objective time asleep (p = 0.0050). Discussion(s): This study of objective sleep measures demonstrated poor sleep quality in patients with rotator cuff tears with shorter sleep duration, frequent awakenings, and decreased efficiency.

Further, they were carried out in sleep laboratories and tended to obtain one-off assessments, thus not taking into account the effect of treatment. We investigated forty (40) patients over the course of 8-week treatment of depression with either paroxetine or nefazodone. We used home polysomnography at baseline, nights 3 and 10, and week 8 of treatment, with extensive assessments of subjective sleep, the morning after each sleep recording. The patients were able to judge accurately their total sleep time and sleep onset latency, both before and during treatment. However, they were inaccurate in estimating the number of times they woke up during the night. Sleep satisfaction correlated negatively with Stage 1 sleep at baseline. Sleep quality was represented by a combination of subjective parameters measuring the ease of initiation and maintenance of sleep, and it appeared to derive from slow wave sleep and sleep continuity as seen in polysomnography. The partial discrepancy between subjective and objective measures suggests that a cognitive element is combined with the biological element to produce the sleep problems reported by depressed patients.

This study compares longitudinal TST data obtained by actigraphy and logs preceding a clinical evaluation, and secondarily ascertains whether longitudinal TST impacts clinicians' decisions to proceed with further sleep testing. METHODS: This was a retrospective, consecutive chart review spanning about 4 months in an academic sleep center. Eighty-four patients wore actigraphs in anticipation of clinical evaluations. Concomitant completion of sleep logs is routinely requested in this setting. Longitudinal TST data available in complete form was reviewed in a blinded fashion among a subset of these patients. A review of text from clinical notes of an expanded cohort with complete actigraphy data (regardless of the degree of completion of logs) enabled determination of the frequency and rationale for cancellation of prescheduled sleep testing. RESULTS: Of 84 actigraphy recordings, 90% produced complete data, and 30% produced fully completed logs. Among the subset with both available in complete form, significant mean TST differences were observed on weekends (7.06 Â± 2.18 hours versus 8.30 Â± 1.93 hours, P = 0.009), but not on weekdays (7.38 Â± 1.97 hours versus 7.72 Â± 1.62 hours, P = 0.450) for actigraphy and logs, respectively. Further analyses revealed poor agreement between the two measures, with predominantly increased TST estimation with logs. Among those with complete actigraphy data (Â±logs), testing was cancelled in 11 (15%), eight of whom (73%) presented with hypersomnia and three of whom (27%) presented with insomnia. Determination of insufficient sleep time was cited as the primary reason for cancellation (64%). CONCLUSION: Actigraphy and sleep logs provided discrepant mean TST data on weekends only, and the latter predominantly estimated increased TST. Actigraphy was completed more reliably than logs. Longitudinal TST information influenced clinicians' decisions to proceed with further testing, particularly among patients presenting with hypersomnia.","1179-1608     Auger, R Robert     Varghese, Ranji     Silber, Michael H     Slocumb, Nancy L     Journal Article     2013/10/15     Nat Sci Sleep. 2013 Oct 3;5:125-31. doi: 10.2147/NSS.S48970. eCollection 2013. | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,multiple sleep latency testing;polysomnography;sleep diaries;Sleep,,,auger_total_2013,Total sleep time obtained from actigraphy versus sleep logs in an academic sleep center and impact on further sleep testing,"Auger et al., 2013",USA,,,1,,,,,,,patients referred to an academic sleep centre,individuals referred for PSG,adults,,,referred for PSG,,,n/a,n/a,84,Actigraphy,,,1,1,,,,Actiwatch AW64,,,Kripke,,,,"Kripke et al., 1978",Actiware Sleep 3.4,Actiware,automated --> sleep diary,,1,,,,1,,,n/a,n/a,,TST,,,,standard,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,n/a,,,sleep diary,generic,1,,,,,,,,,,7 nights,7,matched,1,,,n/a,direct question,question,,1,,,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,0,,,,,,,,,,n/a,,,,,,n/a,not reported,1,,,,,,,,,1,,1,,,,,,,,1,,,,,n/a,"Lin's concordance correlation coefficient, Wilcoxon signed rank test",n/a,,,,,

E-mail: charlotte.cosin@ephe.sorbonne.fr","Objective/Background: Sleep plays a central role in maintaining health and cognition. In most epidemiologic studies, sleep is evaluated by self-report questionnaires but several reports suggest that these evaluations might be less accurate than objective measures such as polysomnography or actigraphy. Determinants of the discrepancy between objective and subjective measures remain to be investigated. The aim of this pilot-study was to examine the role of mood states in determining the discrepancy observed between objective and subjective measures of sleep duration in older adults. Patients/Methods: Objective sleep quantity and quality were recorded by actigraphy in a sample of 45 elderly subjects over at least three consecutive nights. Subjective sleep duration and supplementary data, such as mood status and memory, were evaluated using ecological momentary assessment (EMA). Result(s): A significant discrepancy was observed between EMA and actigraphic measures of sleep duration (p < 0.001). The magnitude of this difference was explained by the patient's mood status (p = 0.020). No association was found between the magnitude of this discrepancy and age, sex, sleep quality or memory performance. Conclusion(s): The discrepancy classically observed between objective and subjective measures of sleep duration can be explained by mood status at the time of awakening.

E-mail: mtbianchi@partners.org","The diagnosis and management of insomnia relies primarily on clinical history. However, patient self-report of sleep-wake times may not agree with objective measurements. We hypothesized that those with shallow or fragmented sleep would under-report sleep quantity, and that this might account for some of the mismatch. We compared objective and subjective sleep-wake times for 277 patients who underwent diagnostic polysomnography. The group included those with insomnia symptoms (n = 92), obstructive sleep apnea (n = 66) or both (n = 119). Mismatch of wake duration was context dependent: all three groups overestimated sleep latency but underestimated wakefulness after sleep onset. The insomnia group underestimated total sleep time by a median of 81 min. However, contrary to our hypothesis, measures of fragmentation (N1, arousal index, sleep efficiency, etc.) did not correlate with the subjective sleep duration estimates. To unmask a potential relationship between sleep architecture and subjective duration, we tested three hypotheses: N1 is perceived as wake; sleep bouts under 10 min are perceived as wake; or N1 and N2 are perceived in a weighted fashion. None of these hypotheses exposed a match between subjective and objective sleep duration. We show only modest performance of a Naive Bayes Classifier algorithm for predicting mismatch using clinical and polysomnographic variables. Subjective-objective mismatch is common in patients reporting insomnia symptoms. We conclude that mismatch was not attributable to commonly measured polysomnographic measures of fragmentation. Further insight is needed into the complex relationships between subjective perception of sleep and conventional, objective measurements.

The Extended Sleep Survey and ESSD were constructed to address the specific job-related characteristics of fire and emergency services that other measurements cannot achieve (eg, multiple sleep episode in a single night). RESULT(S): The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index TST is least accurate compared to actigraphy. The Extended Sleep Survey TST shows improvement over Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index TST, but was statistically different from actigraphy TST. No difference in mean TST was found between ESSD TST and actigraphy TST. Furthermore, ESSD TST and actigraphy TST correlated strongly together.

Self-report is practical and less technically challenging, but prone to bias. We sought to determine whether these methods have comparable sensitivity to measure longitudinal changes in adolescent bedtimes. METHODS: We measured one week of free-living sleep with wrist actigraphy and usual bedtime on school nights and non-school nights with self-report questionnaire in 144 students at 15 y and 17 y. RESULTS: Self-reported and actigraphy-measured bedtimes were correlated with one another at 15 y and 17 y (p < .001), but reported bedtime was consistently earlier (>30 minutes, p < .001) and with wide inter-method confidence intervals (> Â±106 minutes). Mean inter-method discrepancy did not differ on school nights at 15 y and 17 y but was greater at 17 y on non-school nights (p = .002). Inter-method discrepancy at 15 y was not correlated to that at 17 y. Mean change in self-reported school night bedtime from 15 y to 17 y did not differ from that by actigraphy, but self-reported bedtime changed less on non-school nights (p = .002). Two-year changes in self-reported bedtime did not correlate with changes measured by actigraphy. CONCLUSIONS: Although methods were correlated, consistently earlier self-reported bedtime suggests report-bias. More varied non-school night bedtimes challenge the accuracy of self-report and actigraphy, reducing sensitivity to change. On school nights, the methods did not differ in group-level sensitivity to changes in bedtime. However, lack of correlation between bedtime changes by each method suggests sensitivity to individual-level change was different. Methodological differences in sensitivity to individual- and group-level change should be considered in longitudinal studies of adolescent sleep patterns.","2575-6613     Brychta, Robert J     RÃ¶gnvaldsdÃ³ttir, Vaka     GuÃ°mundsdÃ³ttir, SigriÃ°ur L     StefÃ¡nsdÃ³ttir, RÃºna     HrafnkelsdÃ³ttir, Soffia M     GestsdÃ³ttir, Sunna     ArngrÃ­msson, SigurbjÃ¶rn A     Chen, Kong Y     JÃ³hannsson, Erlingur     Z99 DK999999/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States     Journal Article     2019/12/05     J Meas Phys Behav. 2019 Dec;2(4):282-287. doi: 10.1123/jmpb.2019-0021. | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,accelerometer;questionnaire;sleep;sleep onset;teenagers;Adolescent,,,brychta_longitudinal_2019,Longitudinal Change in Adolescent Bedtimes Measured by Self-Report and Actigraphy,"Brychta et al., 2019",Iceland,,,1,,,,,,,"15-year, then 17-year old students of the same cohort",adolescents,adolescents,,,normative,,,n/a,n/a,144,Actigraphy,,,1,1,,,,ActiGraph GT3X+,,,Sadeh,,,,,Actilife 6.13.0,ActiLife,"visual inspection, sleep diaries",,1,,1,,,,,n/a,n/a,,"School bedtime, weekend bedtime",split,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,n/a,,,"sleep diary, single question about bedtime",generic,1,,1,,,,,,,,7 nights,7,matched,1,,,n/a,n/a,,,,,,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,0,,,,,,,,,,n/a,,,,,,n/a,mean values,,1,,,,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,n/a,"Pearson correlations, Bland Altman plots",n/a,,,,,

The present study examined the agreement between self-reported and device-measured parameters of sleep quality in a sample of adults with multiple sclerosis. METHOD(S): Participants (n = 49) completed a 7-day sleep diary and wore a wrist-worn ActiGraph GT3x+ (ActiGraph Corp., Pensecola, FL) for seven consecutive nights to quantify self-reported and device-measured sleep parameters, respectively. RESULT(S): There was a significant discrepancy between self-reported and device-measured parameters of total time in bed (mean difference = 19.8 [51.3] min), sleep onset latency (mean difference = 22.2 [19.5] min), and frequency of awakenings during the night (mean difference = 12.8 [6.8]). Intraclass correlation estimates indicated poor agreement between methods on most parameters, except for total time in bed (intraclass correlation = 0.80). Bland-Altman plots suggested that total time in bed and total sleep time had acceptable levels of agreement and linear regression analyses indicated that sleep onset latency (F = 113.91, B = -1.34, P < .001), number of awakenings (F = 543.34, B = 1.85, P < .001), and sleep efficiency (F = 18.39, B = -0.77, P < .001) had significant proportional bias.

E-mail: mccraec@health.missouri.edu","Study Objectives: Individuals with primary insomnia often have poorer self-reported sleep than objectively measured sleep, a phenomenon termed negative sleep discrepancy. Recent studies suggest that this phenomenon might differ depending on comorbidities. This study examined sleep discrepancy, its night-to-night variability, and its correlates in comorbid insomnia and fibromyalgia. Method(s): Sleep diaries and actigraphy data were obtained from 223 adults with fibromyalgia and insomnia (age = 51.53 [standard deviation = 11.90] years; 93% women) for 14 days. Sleep discrepancy was calculated by subtracting diary from actigraphy estimates of sleep onset latency (SOL-D), wake after sleep onset (WASO-D), and total sleep time (TST-D) for each night. Night-to-night variability in sleep discrepancy was calculated by taking the within-individual standard deviations over 14 days. Participants completed measures of mood, pain, fatigue, sleep/pain medications, nap duration, and caffeine consumption. Result(s): Average sleep discrepancies across 14 days were small for all sleep parameters (< 10 minutes). There was no consistent positive or negative discrepancy. However, sleep discrepancy for any single night was large, with average absolute discrepancies greater than 30 minutes for all sleep parameters. Greater morning pain was associated with larger previous-night WASO-D, although diary and actigraphy estimates of WASO remained fairly concordant. Taking prescribed pain medications, primarily opioids, was associated with greater night-to-night variability in WASO-D and TST-D. Conclusion(s): Unlike patients with primary insomnia, patients with comorbid fibromyalgia do not exhibit consistent negative sleep discrepancy; however, there are both substantial positive and negative discrepancies in all sleep parameters at the daily level. Future research is needed to investigate the clinical significance and implications of high night-to-night variability of sleep discrepancy, and the role of prescribed opioid medications in sleep perception.Copyright Â© 2018 American Academy of Sleep Medicine.

Method(s): We enrolled 420 patients (age 20-79 y) who underwent polysomnography (PSG). They were divided into three groups based on chief complaints: chronic insomnia (CI, n = 69), patients with both obstructive sleep apnea and insomnia (OSA-I, n = 49) or OSA only (OSA, n = 149). Healthy volunteers were also recruited (normal controls [NC], n = 80). We compared differences in PSG parameters and habitual sleep duration and investigated the discrepancy between objective and subjective total sleep time (TST) and sleep latency among four groups. Subjective TST was defined as sleep time perceived by participants the next morning of PSG. Result(s): SP for TST was highest in the OSA group (median 92.9%), and lowest in the CI group (80.3%). SP of the NC group (91.4%) was higher than the CI, but there was no difference between OSA-I and OSA groups. OSA-I had higher depressive mood compared to the OSA group (p < 0.001). SP was positively associated with the presence of OSA and habitual sleep duration and negatively related to the presence of insomnia and arousal index of PSG. Insomnia patients with (OSA-I) or without OSA (CI) reported the smallest discrepancy between habitual sleep duration and objective TST. Conclusion(s): Patients with OSA with or without insomnia have different PSG profiles, which suggests that objective measures of sleep are an important consideration for differentiating subtypes of insomnia and tailoring proper treatment.

In addition, psychological factors have a strong modulatory impact on our sleep, but the exact underlying mechanisms are still largely unknown. Here, we examined the role of intentions on subjective and objective sleep parameters. Young healthy sleepers were instructed to voluntarily either worsen or improve their sleep. We predicted that participants would be capable of worsening, but not improving, their sleep compared to a regular sleep condition. In addition, we predicted that the instruction to alter sleep would lead to a higher discrepancy between subjective and objective sleep variables., PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: Twenty-two healthy students participated in one adaptation and three experimental nights. Polysomnography and subjective sleep parameters were measured during all four nights. Participants were instructed to sleep regularly (""neutral""), better (""good"") or worse (""bad"") than normal, in a counterbalanced order., RESULTS: The instruction to sleep ""bad"" increased objective sleep onset latency and the number of awakings during the night. The effects were stronger on subjective sleep variables, resulting in a higher sleep misperception in the ""bad"" condition as compared to the other two conditions. The instruction to sleep ""good"" did not improve sleep nor did it affect sleep misperception., CONCLUSION: We conclude that intention is sufficient to impair (but not improve) subjective and objective sleep quality and to increase sleep misperception in healthy young sleepers. Our results have important implications for the understanding of the impact of psychological factors on our sleep.

Nonalcoholic insomniacs underestimate their total sleep time (TST) and overestimate their sleep onset latency (SOL) and wake time after sleep onset (WASO) compared with polysomnography (PSG). This study evaluated 3 hypotheses: (1) subjective SOL would predict frequency of future drinking; (2) participants would overestimate SOL and WASO and underestimate TST; and (3) higher amounts of over- and underestimates of sleep at baseline would predict worse drinking outcomes prospectively. Methods: Participants (N = 18), mean age 44.6 years (+/-13.2), underwent an adaptation night and then 2 nights of PSG 3 weeks apart. They also provided morning estimates of SOL, WASO, TST, and sleep efficiency (SE). Following the baseline PSG, participants were followed over 12 weeks. A 2-way ANOVA (night method of measuring sleep) compared results and regression analyses predicted drinking. Drinking outcomes were defined as number of days drinking (DD) and number of heavydrinking days (HDD) during 2 consecutive 6-week follow-up periods. Results: Most participants (72%) overestimated SOL by a mean of 21.3 (+/-36) minutes compared with PSG [F(1, 14)57.1, p < 0.03]. Unexpectedly, 89% underestimated WASO by a mean difference of 48.7 (+/-49) minutes [F(1, 14)515.6, p < 0.01]. Drinking during the first 6-week study period was predicted by both subjective estimates of WASO and their accuracy, whereas drinking during the second 6-week period was predicted by both subjective estimations of sleep and rapid eye movement sleep latency. Conclusion: Greater subjective accuracy of wakefulness at night provided by the patient predicted drinking during the study. Unlike nonalcoholic insomniacs, this alcoholic sample significantly underestimated WASO compared with PSG values. The predictive ability of sleep parameters depended on the selected measure of drinking outcomes and when outcomes were measured. Subjective sleep measures were better predictors of future drinking than corresponding PSG measures.

Over 1 week of simultaneous sleep log and actigraph recording, the average disagreement between methods ranged from 16 min for sleep onset latency to 1 hr for wake time after sleep onset. Interrater agreement for the severity of insomnia symptoms using the Sleep Impairment Index was poor for subject-clinician, subject-collateral, and collateral-clinician rating pairs (intraclass correlation coefficients < .35). In general, recovering alcoholics' self-reported sleep reflected a greater severity of insomnia symptoms than did the actigraph and collateral measures.

This study compared theCSDwith 3 othermethods to assess sleep duration, efficiency, and timing. Method(s): Participants (n = 80) were community adults (mean age = 32.65 years, 63% female) who completed the time-stamped CSD and used single-channel electroencephalography (EEG) and actigraphy for 7 days at home, then completed a retrospective sleep questionnaire. Total sleep time (TST), sleep efficiency (SE), and sleep midpoint were compared using correlations, Bland-Altman plots, and limits of agreement (adjusted for repeated measures). Result(s): Correlations between the CSD and allmethods on TSTwere large (rs=.63-.75). AdjustedCSD average TSTwas 40minutes greater than with EEGand 31 minutes greater than with actigraphy. Correlations between CSD, actigraphy, and EEG for SE were small (rs = .18), and there was a medium correlation with questionnaire (r =.42). AdjustedCSDaverage SE was 7%greater thanEEGand 6%greater than actigraphy; both demonstrated heteroscedasticity. Sleepmidpoint correlations between CSD and all methods were large (r =.92-.99). Adjusted CSD was, on average, 6minutes later than EEG and 1minute later than actigraphy. Questionnaire-derived sleep parameters demonstrated nonconstant bias; lesser values had positive bias and greater values had negative bias. Conclusion(s): The time-stamped CSD led tomeaningful overestimations of TSTand SE as measured by objective/inferred methods. However, sleep timing was rather accurately assessed with the CSD in comparison to objective/inferred measures. Researchers should carefully consider which sleep assessment methods are best aligned with their research question and parameters of interest, as methods do not demonstrate complete agreement.Copyright Â© 2021 American Academy of Sleep Medicine.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,*actimetry;adult;article;*community sample;*consensus;controlled study;*electroencephalography;female;human;human experiment;limit of agreement;major clinical study;male;*questionnaire;retrospective study;sleep efficiency;*sleep time;Questionnaires;Electroencephalography,,,dietch_evaluation_2021,"Evaluation of the Consensus Sleep Diary in a community sample: Comparison with single-channel electroencephalography, actigraphy, and retrospective questionnaire","Dietch & Taylor, 2021",USA,,,1,,1,,,,,representative community-based normative sample,normative,adults,,,normative,,,n/a,n/a,80,"Single channel EEG (Zmachine), Actigraphy",1,,1,1,single channel EEG,,single channel EEG,Actiwatch Spectrum,,,Actiware Low (10),,,,,Actiware 6.0,Actiware,event markers --> sleep diaries --> activity/light patterns,1,1,1,1,,,,,n/a,n/a,,"TST, SE, sleep midpoint (bedtime-waketime/2) ",,,,standard,,,,,,TST/TIB*100,,,1,,,1,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,n/a,,,"consensus sleep diary, PSQI","Consensus Sleep Diary, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)",1,,,,1,,,,,,7 nights,7,matched,1,,,TST/TIB * 100,TIB-SOL-WASO-TWAK,TIB-SOL-WASO-TWAK,,,1,,LO-RT,direct question,direct question,direct question,n/a,0,,,,,,,,,,n/a,,,,,,n/a,"linear mixed models, separate analyses",,,,,,,1,,,1,1,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,n/a,"Bland-altman plots analyses, pearson correlations across CSD, EEG, actigraphy, PSQI; mixed model with measure (EEG, actigraphy, CSD) and participant as fixed effects, measure x participant interaction as random effect, determining prediction intervals for week average TST, SE, sleep midpoint CSD, EEG, actigraphy each versus questionnaire",n/a,,,,,

SSM is a form of primary insomnia. The aim of this study was to record psychological functioning measures (anxiety, depression, ability to feel pleasure, obsessive-compulsive traits) in a population of patients with primary insomnia and to evaluate the relationship between these measures and the patients' perception of their sleep. Material(s) and Method(s): Seventy-six consecutive patients with primary insomnia were enrolled: 34 men and 42 women, mean age 53.9 +/- 13.1. Sleep study included the following: Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Berlin's Questionnaire and home-based polysomnography. Psychometric evaluation included the following: Self-Administered Anxiety Scale, Beck's Depression Inventory, Maudsley's Obsessive Compulsive Inventory, Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale, Eating Attitude Test. Result(s): All patients with insomnia had psychometric scores higher than the general population, but very few patients, in both groups, had anxiety or depression scores consistent with severe mood or anxiety disorders. Comparisons between subjective and objective scores confirmed that most sleep parameters were underestimated. Patients with SSM had lower anxiety scores as compared to patients without SSM. Conclusion(s): The study did not succeed in identifying any predictor of sleep misperception. We speculate that a group of patients, rather than being extremely worried by their insomnia, may have a sort of agnosia of their sleep.

Over 6 consecutive days and nights, 23 elite Australian judo athletes were monitored while attending a camp at the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS). In 14 athletes, all electronic devices were removed on days 3 and 4 (i.e., for 48 hours: the ""device-restricted group""), whereas 9 were permitted to use their devices throughout the camp (the ""control group""). All athletes wore an activity monitor (Readiband) continuously to provide measures of sleep quantity and quality. Other self-reported (diary) measures included time in bed, electronic device use, and rate of perceived exertion during training periods. Cognitive performance (Cogstate) and physical performance (single leg triple hop test) were also measured. When considering night 2 as a ""baseline"" for each group, removal of electronic devices on nights 3 and 4 (device-restricted group) resulted in no significant differences in any sleep-related measure between the groups. When comparing actigraphy-based measures of sleep to subjective measures, all athletes significantly overestimated sleep duration by 58 +/- 85 minutes (p = 0.001) per night and underestimated time of sleep onset by 37 +/- 72 minutes (p = 0.001) per night.

Additionally, at 16 to 21 weeks (visit 2), a subgroup completed a week-long sleep diary coincident with an actigraphy recording.

The arousal index within total sleep time was increased, which was mainly because of a strong increase within rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Subjectively, more PI than GSC subjects estimated wake times longer than obtained from PSG. Linear modeling analysis of subjective wake time in terms of PSG parameters revealed that in addition to PSG defined wake time, REM sleep time contributed significantly to subjective wake time. This REM sleep contribution was larger for PI than for GSC subjects.

Sleep estimates instead of exact EEG-recorded total sleep time is often used in the clinical setting. However, an overestimated sleep time would underestimate the degree of the disease and vice versa. The purpose of this study was to investigate the accuracy of subjective sleep time and time-in-bed as sleep estimates. One hundred patients undergoing diagnostic polysomnography for suspected obstructive sleep apnoea were asked to estimate their sleep time in a questionnarie. Seventy-five patients were diagnosed as suffering from obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome. The mean difference between self-scored and EEG-recorded total sleep time was 4 +/- 74 min. However, 30% scored with a difference than greater than 1 h. The intra-class correlation coefficient was fair (0.58, CI: 0.43- 0.70). Fifty-three patients overestimated their sleep time and 47 patients underestimated it. All but four patients underestimated their number of awakenings (P<0.001). The mean difference between time-in-bed and EEG-recorded total sleep time was 110 +/- 63 min. This difference was significantly larger than the difference between subjective sleep time and EEG-recorded total sleep time (P < 0.001). The intra-class correlation coefficient was poor (0.38, CI: 0.20-0.54). Mean AHI was 27 +/- 27 using subjective sleep time and did not change significantly compared with the mean AHI of 25 +/- 21 based on EEG-recorded total sleep time. Mean AHI decreased significantly to 20+/-17 (P<0.001) when time-in- bed was used. In conclusion, 'time-in-bed' time is a poor predictor of total sleep time and should not be used when calculating the apnoea-hypopnoea index. Subjective sleep time is better as an approximation, but the individual differences are large.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,adult;aged;arousal;article;breathing;controlled study;diagnostic accuracy;electroencephalogram;female;human;information processing;major clinical study;male;polysomnography;priority journal;questionnaire;recording;self report;*sleep apnea syndrome/di [Diagnosis];*sleep time;sleep waking cycle,,,franklin_accuracy_2000,The accuracy of subjective sleep time in sleep apnoea recordings,"Franklin & Svanborg, 2000",Sweden,,,1,,,,,,,individuals referred to sleep center for suspected OSA,individuals referred for PSG,adults,,,referred for PSG,,,n/a,n/a,100,PSG,1,1,,,,,,n/a,,,,,,,,n/a,n/a,n/a,,,,,,,,,R&K,in-lab,nocturnal,"TIB, TST, awakenings",,,,standard,,,,,,,,standard,1,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,n/a,,,morning questionnaire,generic,,,1,,,,,,,,1 night,1,matched,1,,,n/a,calculated from TIB-SOL-WASO,TIB-SOL-WASO,,,1,,LO-RT,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,0,,,,,,,,,,n/a,,,,,,n/a,single night,,,1,,,,,,,,1,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,n/a,intrclass correlations and Bland-Altman plots,n/a,,,,,

Several validated questionnaires have been developed to assess sleep, but these tools are lengthy to administer and may be impractical for epidemiologic studies. We examined whether a 3-item sleep questionnaire, similar to those typically used in epidemiologic studies, closely corresponded with objective measures of sleep as assessed using actigraphy monitoring. Method(s): Eligible participants were Western Australian women aged 18 to 80 years. Participants completed a sleep questionnaire, wore a wrist actigraph for 7 nights, and completed a brief daily sleep log. Objective actigraphy measurements for 56 participants were summarized by mean and mode and compared with the subjective reports, using weighted kappa and delta. Result(s): Data collected from the questionnaire showed poor agreement with objectively measured sleep, with kappas ranging from -0.19 to 0.14. Conclusion(s): Our results indicate that sleep questions typically used in epidemiologic studies do not closely correspond with objective measures of sleep as assessed using actigraphy. The findings have implications for studies that have used such sleep questions. A means of appropriately measuring sleep as a risk factor in epidemiologic studies remains to be determined.

We hypothesized that insomnia complaints in older adults would be associated with objective differences in sleep compared with those without insomnia complaints. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a cross-sectional study in which older adults with insomnia complaints (cases, n=100) were compared with older adults without insomnia complaints (controls, n=100) using dual-night in-lab nocturnal polysomnography, study questionnaires and 7days of at-home actigraphy and sleep diaries. Cases were noted to have reduced objective total sleep time compared with controls (25.8+/-8.56min, P=0.003). This was largely due to increased wakefulness after sleep onset, and not increased sleep latency. When participants with sleep-related breathing disorder or periodic limb movement disorder were excluded, the polysomnography total sleep time difference became even larger. Cases also had reduced slow-wave sleep (5.10+/-1.38min versus 10.57+/- 2.29min, effect size -0.29, P=0.04). When comparing self-reported sleep latency and sleep efficiency with objective polysomnographic findings, cases demonstrated low, but statistically significant correlations, while no such correlations were observed in controls. Cases tended to underestimate their sleep efficiency by 1.6% (+/-18.4%), while controls overestimated their sleep efficiency by 12.4% (+/-14.5%). In conclusion, we noted that older adults with insomnia complaints have significant differences in several objective sleep findings relative to controls, suggesting that insomnia complaints in older adults are associated with objective impairments in sleep.

Method(s): At-home ambulatory polysomnograms (PSGs) of 31 people with insomnia were recorded. Participants performed a time estimation task and completed the Pre Sleep Arousal Scale (PSAS). Based on previous modelling of the relationship between objectively measured sleep fragmentation and sleep onset misperception, the subjective sleep onset was estimated for each participant as the start of the first uninterrupted sleep bout longer than 30 min. Subsequently, the component of misperception not explained by sleep fragmentation was calculated as the residual error between estimated sleep onset and perceived sleep onset. This residual error was correlated with individual time estimation task results and PSAS scores. Result(s): A negative correlation between time estimation task results and the residual error of the sleep onset model was found, indicating that participants who overestimated a time interval during the day also overestimated their sleep onset latency (SOL). No correlation was found between PSAS scores and residual error. Conclusion(s): Interindividual variations of sleep architecture possibly obscure the correlation of sleep onset misperception with time estimation and pre sleep arousal, especially in small groups. Therefore, we used a previously proposed model to account for the influence of sleep fragmentation. Results indicate that time estimation is associated with sleep onset misperception. Since sleep onset misperception appears to be a general characteristic of insomnia, understanding the underlying mechanisms is probably important for understanding and treating insomnia.Copyright Â© 2020 The Author(s)","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,adult;age distribution;*arousal;article;controlled study;electroencephalography;electromyography;electrooculography;female;human;insomnia;major clinical study;male;neurologic examination;polysomnography;priority journal;prospective study;sex difference;*sleep fragmentation (procedure);sleep parameters;sleep quality;*stage 1 sleep;task performance;pre sleep arousal scale;Arousal;Sleep Deprivation,,,hermans_sleep_2020,"Sleep onset (mis)perception in relation to sleep fragmentation, time estimation and pre-sleep arousal","Hermans et al., 2020",Netherlands,,,1,1,,,,,1,participants with insomnia on a waitlist for CBT-I,insomnia,adults,,,insomnia,,,n/a,n/a,31,PSG,1,1,,,,,,n/a,,,,,,,,n/a,n/a,n/a,,,,,,,,,AASM,home-based,nocturnal,SOL,,,,,,first epoch of any sleep stage,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,n/a,,,consensus sleep diary,Consensus Sleep Diary,1,,,,,,,,,,1 night,1,matched,1,,,n/a,n/a,,,,,,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,sSOL-oSOL,1,dTST,,,,,,,,,0,1,,,,,Algebraic difference score,single night,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,n/a,correlation between residual error of SOL estimation model and results of a time estimation task *does this go in individual?,residual error of SOL estimation model (sleep onset misperception not explained by sleep fragmentation),,,,1,

Responses to these questions correlate moderately with objectively measured sleep duration in nonpregnant individuals, but little is known about the validity of self-reported sleep measures in pregnancy. The aim of the present study was to determine the extent to which self-reported gestational sleep duration assessed by questionnaire predicted objectively measured gestational sleep duration via actigraphy. Method(s): We analyzed data from 80 mothers enrolled in an ancillary study of Project BABIES, a prospective cohort study of urban, pregnant women. Sleep measurements were collected in midpregnancy and included 7 days of wrist actigraphy, a sleep log, and survey questions about sleep time adapted from the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Result(s): Mean measured gestational sleep duration derived from actigraphy was 6.87 h [standard deviation (SD) 0.87], and questionnaire-assessed nocturnal sleep time averaged 7.29 h (SD 1.84). While the difference between measures did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.07 for paired samples t test), over half (62 %) of participants reported a habitual average nightly sleep time that differed more than 1 h from their average actigraphically measured sleep duration (39 % overestimated by more than an hour; 23 % underestimated by more than an hour). There was no correlation between measures (r = 0.007; 95 % confidence interval -0.21, 0.23). Conclusion(s): Questionnaire-derived reports of usual sleep hours do not reflect objectively measured sleep time in urban, pregnant women. Actigraphy is preferable to accurately assess gestational sleep duration.

Sleep disturbances are a key feature of major depression. Electroconvulsive treatment (ECT) may improve polysomnography-assessed sleep characteristics, but its short-term effects on actigraphy-assessed and subjective sleep characteristics are unknown. We therefore aimed to assess the effects of ECT on subjective and objective sleep parameters in a proof-of-principle study. Methods. We assessed subjective and objective sleep parameters in 12 severely depressed patients up to 5 consecutive days during their ECT course, corresponding to a total of 43 nights (including 19 ECT sessions). The 12 patients were 83% female and on average 62 (standard deviation (SD) 14) years old and had an average MADRS score of 40 at baseline (SD 21). Results. Subjective and objective sleep parameters were not directly affected by ECT. The subjective sleep efficiency parameter was similar on the day after ECT and other days. ECT did not affect the number of errors in the Sustained Attention to Response Task. Patients subjectively underestimated their total sleep time by 1.4 hours (P < 0.001) compared to actigraphy-assessed sleep duration. Conclusion. ECT did not affect subjective and actigraphy-assessed sleep in the short term.

E-mail: henrikih@uio.no","Background: The concept of misperception of sleep refers to the estimated discrepancy between subjective and objective measures of sleep. This has been assessed only in a few prior studies in individuals with Bipolar Disorder (BD) as compared to Healthy Controls (HC) and with mixed results. Method(s): We assessed a sample of 133 euthymic individuals with BD and 63 HC for retrospective subjective (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index) and objective (21 days of actigraphy recording) measures of total sleep time, sleep latency and sleep efficiency. We first investigated the correlations between these subjective and objective measures in the two groups. We then compared individuals with BD and HC for the absolute values of the differences between subjective and objective sleep parameters, used as a proxy of the magnitude of misperception of sleep. Finally, we undertook regression analyses to assess associations between clinical groups, core demographics, clinical factors and misperception of sleep. Result(s): The correlation coefficients between subjective and objective measures of sleep did not differ between groups (total sleep time: rho =.539 in BD and rho =.584 in HC; sleep latency: rho =.190 in BD and rho =.125 in HC; sleep efficiency: rho =.166 in BD and rho =.222 in HC). Individuals with BD did not differ from HC in the magnitude of misperception of total sleep time, sleep latency nor sleep efficiency. Individuals with BD type 1 misperceived their sleep efficiency significantly more than individuals with BD type 2, with no further difference between BD type 1 and BD type 2 regarding sleep latency and sleep duration misperceptions. Three factors (age, symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea, and mild depressive symptoms), were the main contributors to the magnitude of misperception of sleep. Conclusion(s): Misperception of sleep was not associated with a diagnosis of BD. In this sample, mild depressive symptoms, older age, or symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea may be related to greater sleep misperception. In that case, the reliability of subjective measures may decrease as the misperception of sleep increases. This study may help guide clinicians in selecting the best approach for assessing sleep (objective versus subjective measures) in individuals with BD.Copyright Â© 2020, The Author(s).","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,*actimetry;adult;article;*bipolar disorder;comparative study;controlled study;depression;female;human;major clinical study;male;middle aged;Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale;Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index;priority journal;*questionnaire;retrospective study;*sleep disorder;sleep disordered breathing;sleep efficiency;sleep latency;sleep parameters;sleep time;structured interview;Young Mania Rating Scale;actigraph;Berlin questionnaire;*sleep misperception;Actiwatch AW-7;Bipolar Disorder;Questionnaires;Sleep,,,ihler_misperception_2020,Misperception of sleep in bipolar disorder: an exploratory study using questionnaire versus actigraphy,"Ihler et al., 2020",France,Norway,,1,1,,,,,,individuals with bipolar disorder and healthy controls,bipolar disorder,adults,,,bipolar disorder,,,individuals with bipolar disorder,healthy controls,196,Actigraphy,,,1,1,,,,Actiwatch AW7,,,Actiware (not reported),,,,,Actiwatch activity & sleep analysis 7.28,Actiwatch activity & sleep analysis,event markers,,,,,,,,,n/a,n/a,,"TST, SOL, SE",,,,standard,,actigraphy-defined,,,,TST/TIB*100,,,1,1,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,n/a,,,PSQI,Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI),,,,,1,,,,,,21 nights,21,habitual,,1,,TST/TIB * 100,direct question,question,,1,,,LO-RT,n/a,n/a,n/a,|sTST-oTST|,1,absTST,,,,,,,,,0,,1,,,,Absolute difference score,mean values,,1,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,n/a,spearman correlations between subjective and objective,n/a,,,,,

E-mail: marta.jackowska.09@ucl.ac.uk","Objectives: Self-reported sleep efficiency may not precisely reflect objective sleep patterns. We assessed whether psychosocial factors and affective responses are associated with discrepancies between subjective reports and objective measures of sleep efficiency. Method(s): Participants were 199 working women aged 20 to 61 years. Standardized questionnaires were used to assess psychosocial characteristics and affect that included work stress, social support, happiness, and depressive symptoms. Objective measures of sleep were assessed on one week and one leisure night with an Actiheart monitor. Self-reported sleep efficiency was derived from the Jenkins Sleep Problems Scale. Discrepancies between self-reported and objective measures of sleep efficiency were computed by contrasting standardized measures of sleep problems with objectively measured sleep efficiency. Result(s): Participants varied markedly in the discrepancies between self-reported and objective sleep measures. After adjustment for personal income, age, having children, marital status, body mass index, and negative affect, overcommitment (p = .002), low level of social support (p = .049), and poor self-rated heath (p = .02) were associated with overreporting of sleep difficulties and underestimation of sleep efficiency. Self-reported poor sleep efficiency was more prevalent among those more overcommitted at work (p = .009) and less happy (p = .02), as well as among those with lower level of social support (p = .03) and more depressive symptoms (p = .048), independently of covariates. Objective sleep efficiency was unrelated to psychosocial characteristics or affect. Conclusion(s): The extent to which self-reported evaluations of sleep efficiency reflect objective experience may be influenced by psychosocial characteristics and affect. Unless potential moderators of self-reported sleep efficiency are taken into account, associations between sleep and psychosocial factors relevant to health may be overestimated.

We examined relative power values in standard frequency bands of the EEG spectra during the first Non-Rapid Eye Movement (NREM) sleep period as correlates of SOD of SOL between sleep diary and polysomnography in MDD (n=36), PI (n=19), and NSC (n=23) groups. We also compared the relative spectral power of sleep EEG among MDD (n=40), PI (n=19), and NSC (n=23) groups. SOD of SOL in MDD patients was positively correlated with relative sigma (r=0.622, p corrected<0.001), beta power (r=0.559, p corrected=0.002), and alpha power (r=0.469, p corrected=0.024) in the first NREM sleep period. There was no significant difference of sleep EEG power spectra among the three groups. SOD was positively correlated with high frequency EEG in MDD. High frequency EEG power is thought to be associated with hyperarousal and memory consolidation, and future larger-scale studies may further elucidate the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying SOD of sleep onset duration.

Actigraphy is an important clinical and research tool for examining sleep, but has not yet been systematically compared to polysomnography or sleep diary in bipolar disorder. The present study compares actigraphy, polysomnography, and sleep diary estimates of five standard sleep parameters in individuals with bipolar disorder and matched controls across two nights of assessment. Method(s): Twenty-seven individuals who met diagnostic criteria for bipolar disorder type I or II and were currently between mood episodes, along with 27 matched controls with no history of psychopathology or sleep disturbance, underwent two nights of research laboratory monitoring. Sleep was estimated via polysomnography, actigraphy, and sleep diary. Result(s): Over the 108 nights available for comparison, sleep parameter estimates from actigraphy and polysomnography were highly correlated and did not differ between the two groups or across the two nights for sleep onset latency, wake after sleep onset, number of awakenings, total sleep time, or sleep efficiency percentage. The medium wake threshold algorithm in the actigraphy software was the most concordant with polysomnography and diaries across the five sleep parameters. Concordance between actigraphy, polysomnography, and sleep diary was largely independent of insomnia presence and medication use. Conclusion(s): Actigraphy is a valid tool for estimating sleep length and fragmentation in bipolar disorder.

Seventy-six subjects (63.9%), 22 to 32 years of age, presented perfect data for the analysis. The mean sleep times, in minutes, judged by sleep diary and by accelerometer, were 482.3 and 629.6, respectively. The mean percentages and standard deviations of agreement on wake and sleep were 77.5% (SD = 10.2) and 86.1% (SD = 6.2), respectively. There was a significant negative relationship between the agreement rates for wake and sleep (r = -.482, p < .01). The accelerometer showed some measurement failure during waking, presumably because of the decrease in body movement. Sleep diary data during daytime appear to be more valid for detecting a sleep/wake cycle than are accelerometer data.

Cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia improves sleep quality and decreases subjective-objective sleep discrepancy. This study describes differences between older adults with insomnia and controls in sleep discrepancy, and tests the hypothesis that reduced sleep discrepancy following cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia correlates with the magnitude of symptom improvement reported by older adults with insomnia. Participants were 63 adults >60 years of age with insomnia, and 51 controls. At baseline, participants completed sleep diaries for 7 days while wearing wrist actigraphs. After receiving cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia, insomnia patients repeated this sleep assessment. Sleep discrepancy variables were calculated by subtracting actigraphic sleep onset latency and wake after sleep onset from respective self-reported estimates, pre- and post-treatment. Mean level and night-to-night variability in sleep discrepancy were investigated. Baseline sleep discrepancies were compared between groups. Pre-post-treatment changes in Insomnia Severity Index score and sleep discrepancy variables were investigated within older adults with insomnia. Sleep discrepancy was significantly greater and more variable across nights in older adults with insomnia than controls, P <= 0.001 for all. Treatment with cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia was associated with significant reduction in the Insomnia Severity Index score that correlated with changes in mean level and night-to-night variability in wake after sleep onset discrepancy, P < 0.001 for all. Study of sleep discrepancy patterns may guide more targeted treatments for late-life insomnia.Copyright Â© 2014 European Sleep Research Society.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,actimetry;*adulthood;aged;aging;article;cognitive therapy;controlled study;correlation analysis;female;human;*insomnia/di [Diagnosis];*insomnia/th [Therapy];Insomnia Severity Index;major clinical study;male;night sleep;priority journal;self report;sensor;*sleep parameters;*sleep pattern;sleep quality;sleep waking cycle;treatment outcome;sleep diary;*sleep discrepancy;sleep onset latency;wake after sleep onset;Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders,,,kay_discrepancy_2015,Subjective-objective sleep discrepancy among older adults: Associations with insomnia diagnosis and insomnia treatment,"Kay et al., 2015",USA,,,,1,,,,,,older adults with and without insomnia,insomnia,adults,,,insomnia,,,63 older adults with insomnia,51 older adults with good sleep,114,Actigraphy,,,1,1,,,,Actiwatch 2,,,Actiware Medium (40),Cole-Kripke,,,,Actiware 5,Actiware,event marker; sleep diary; activity; light,1,1,1,1,,,,,n/a,n/a,,"SOL, WASO",,,,,,actigraphy-defined,,,,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,n/a,,,sleep diary,generic,1,,,,,,,,,,7 nights,7,matched,1,,,n/a,n/a,,,,,,n/a,direct question,direct question,direct question,"sSOL-oSOL, sWASO-oWASO",1,dSOL,dWASO,,,,,,,,0,1,,,,,algebraic difference score,mean discrepancy values,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,n/a,n/a,n/a,,,,,

To examine whether older adults exhibit a similar pattern, this study compared night-to-night inconsistency in sleep discrepancy between older adults with and without sleep complaints. Older adults (N = 103; mean age = 72.81, SD = 7.12) wore an Actiwatch-L (24 hr per day) and concurrently completed sleep diaries for 14 days. Sleep discrepancy = diary (sleep onset latency [SOL] or wake [time] after sleep onset [WASO]) - actigraphy (SOL or WASO).

Thirty-seven subjects had a polysomnography prior to a work day. After rising they completed the Karolinska Sleep Diary. A factor analysis of the diary yielded two factors: (1) a sleep-quality index (SQI) related to the initiation and maintenance of sleep, and (2) a second factor related to difficulties waking-up and to whether sleep was recuperative and sufficient. The strongest predictors (multiple regression) of the sleep quality index was slow-wave sleep (SWS) and sleep efficiency [and variables related to sleep continuity - total sleep time (TST) and the amount of stage 0]. The obtained results were in agreement with previous laboratory findings.

Polysomnography (PSG) is the gold standard diagnostic tool but is not easily available in all jurisdictions. We aimed to evaluate various questionnaires and wrist actigraphy as screening tools for sleep disorders in the context of ESKD, by comparing results to unattended home PSG results. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Consecutive patients with advanced CKD or ESKD were recruited and assessed using a combination of self-reported instruments (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, International Restless Legs Questionnaire, Short Form 36), wrist actigraphy, and unattended home PSG. The utility of the questionnaires was summarized. Agreement between acti-graphy and PSG scores was assessed. RESULT(S): There was a high prevalence of self-reported sleep disturbance among the 54 participants. The questionnaires had low positive and negative predictive values for their corresponding PSG-measured variables. There were no significant differences between paired PSG and actigraphy summary results for sleep efficiency and time spent awake after sleep onset (n = 27 paired comparisons). CONCLUSION(S): Commonly used screening questionnaires do not accurately predict sleep disorders in the context of advanced CKD or ESKD. Wrist actigraphy accurately identifies those with low sleep efficiency and long time spent awake after sleep onset, who are likely to have the highest diagnostic yield with PSG. Neither approach obviates the need for PSG for accurate diagnosis of sleep disorders in this population.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,"actimetry;adult;article;*chronic kidney failure;controlled study;diagnosis;diagnostic test accuracy study;diagnostic value;*disease course;end stage renal disease;Epworth sleepiness scale;female;human;major clinical study;male;Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index;polysomnography;predictive value;prevalence;questionnaire;restless legs syndrome;Short Form 36;*sleep disorder;sleep quality;stage 1 sleep;wakefulness;wrist;Kidney;Kidney Failure, Chronic;Mass Screening;Kidney Diseases",,,kennedy_screening_2020,Screening for sleep disorders in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease or end-stage kidney disease,"Kennedy et al., 2020",Ireland,,,1,,,,,,,patients with advanced chronic kidney disease or end-stage kidney disease,kidney disease,adults,,,kidney disease,,,n/a,n/a,54,PSG,1,1,,,,,,n/a,,,,,,,,n/a,n/a,n/a,,,,,,,,,AASM,home-based,nocturnal,sleep quality [PSQI; PSG SE],,,,,,,,,,TST/TIB*100,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,PSQI total score,PSQI scores,SE,SE,n/a,,,PSQI,Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI),,,,,1,,,,,,1 night,1,matched,1,,,n/a,n/a,,,,,,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,0,,,,,,,,,,n/a,,,,,,n/a,single night,,,1,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,n/a,"sensitivity,specificity,PPV,NPV of binary categories PSQI ≥ 5 for PSG < 85%; spearman correlation PSQI and SE",n/a,,,,,

Anthropometric measurements, fasting lipid profiles and validated questionnaires on sleep duration were performed. A subgroup (n=138) was randomly selected for both questionnaires and actigraphy to assess the agreement between subjective and objective measurements of sleep duration., RESULTS: We studied 2053 healthy children and adolescents aged 6-20 years. Their mean ages were 13.0+/-3.3 (boys) and 13.6+/-3.3 (girls) years. The average sleep duration during schooldays, weekends, and long holidays was 8.0+/-1.1, 9.6+/-1.2, and 9.8+/-1.2h in boys and 7.7+/-1.1, 9.9+/-1.2, and 10.1+/-1.2h in girls, respectively. Using logistic regression, age, and pubertal stage were associated with obesity in secondary school students, whereas male gender and short sleep duration were associated with obesity in primary school children. In secondary school children, those with long sleep duration, as compared to those with short sleep duration, were significantly associated with reduced risk to have high TC and LDL-C levels after adjustment for age, gender, BMI, and pubertal stage. There was no significant association between sleep duration and lipid levels in primary school children., CONCLUSION: Reduced sleep duration was associated with obesity and atherogenic dyslipidemia in young school children in Hong Kong.

Nurses assessed sleep/wake status at hourly checks and patients completed a sleep diary. For three nights patients wore a wrist actigraph, a portable instrument which provides objective data about sleep/wake activity. The nursing and patient data obtained were compared with actigraphy data. Nursing staff evaluated sleep with satisfactory agreement (76.5% night 1 and 81.6% night 3) that improved over the first three nights of hospitalization (p < 0.03). When the nurses' report did not agree with the actigraph, they tended to overestimate sleep. Patients tended to underestimate their total sleep time and total time awake after sleep onset. Time in bed and initial sleep latency were overestimated. There was great intersubject variability, making determination of agreement impossible. This data suggest that treatment teams on psychiatric units should in general consider nursing reports of sleep more accurate than patient self-report. However, since nursing staff and patients observe different aspects of sleep, both sources of data are important to inpatient treatment teams on clinical units.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,*actimetry;adult;aged;article;controlled study;female;hospitalization;human;intermethod comparison;major clinical study;male;*mental patient;nursing staff;observation;patient monitoring;priority journal;psychiatric department;self report;*sleep disorder/di [Diagnosis];sleep time;sleep waking cycle;wrist,,,krahn_assessing_1997,Assessing sleep in psychiatric inpatients: Nurse and patient reports versus wrist actigraphy,"Krahn et al., 1997",USA,,,1,,,,,,,psychiatric inpatients,psychiatric inpatients,adults,,,psychiatric inpatients,,,n/a,n/a,30,Actigraphy,,,1,1,,,,not reported,,,Cole-Kripke,,,,,not reported,not reported,scored manually (tech was blinded to sleep diary),,,,1,,,,Scorer blind to diary,n/a,n/a,,"TST, TIB, SOL, WASO",,,,standard,,actigraphy-defined,,,,,,,1,1,1,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,n/a,,,sleep diary,generic,1,,,,,,,,,,3 nights,3,matched,1,,,not reported,not reported,not reported,,,,,not reported,not reported,not reported,not reported,n/a,0,,,,,,,,,,n/a,,,,,,n/a,separate analyses,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,n/a,"percentage agreement between methods, numeric comparisons of absolute differences between methods",n/a,,,,,

We aimed to assess subjective-objective sleep discrepancy in subjects with insomnia disorder as well as the psychological factors associated with the discrepancy., METHODS: This study is a secondary analysis of the baseline data of a randomized controlled study on 110 adults aged 18 years to 59 years with insomnia disorder. Subjective reports on sleep and the objective measures acquired by an overnight polysomnography were used to measure the sleep discrepancy. Smartphone Addiction Proneness Scale (SAPS), Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), beck anxiety inventory (BAI), and Global Assessment of Recent Stress (GARS) were used to evaluate the psychological factors associated with the sleep discrepancy., RESULTS: Mean total sleep time (TST) discrepancy of the participants was -81.65+/-97.41 minutes. Multivariable logistic regression analyses revealed that age (adjusted OR=1.07, 95% CI=1.01-1.13, p=0.027), years of education (adjusted OR=0.69, 95% CI=0.48-0.91, p=0.017), and smartphone addiction proneness (adjusted OR=1.14, 95% CI=1.04-1.27, p=0.008) were independent predictors of TST misperception.

Many studies traditionally collect data on sleep using questionnaires or sleep diaries. An increasing popular alternative is a wrist-worn device. The accuracy of these devices is uncertain, and assessment of this accuracy is important.Introduction: The purpose of this study is to compare consensus sleep diary (CSD) and an actigraphy-based wrist-worn device (Fitbit AltaTM [Fitbit, San Francisco, CA]) measurements of total sleep time (TST), sleep onset latency, wake time after sleep onset, number of awakenings, and sleep efficiency.Materials and Methods: Ten healthy young adults (50% female, 100% Asian) in the age range between 20 to 24 years old wore a Fitbit Alta around their nondominated hand during seven consecutive nights. The participants also filled in a CSD every day. Result(s): On average, the wrist-worn device (Fitbit Alta) recorded a TST per night of 437.15min, which is 5.46min shorter on average than the CSD recorded (442.61min). Bland-Altman plots indicate that there is large variance in the sleep recorded between FitbitTM (Fitbit, San Francisco, CA) and CSD. For example, Fitbit recorded 2.15 more awakenings per night than CSD, which is equal to 13.09min on average longer wake time after sleep onset. Conclusion(s): Fitbit and CSD show significant differences in recording sleep. We find that for most sleep metrics, the level of disagreement is small enough for the devices to be interchangeably used except for recording wakes during the night.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,actimetry;*devices;*electronic device;female;Hong Kong;human;male;normal human;*physiology;sleep;wrist;young adult;Sleep;Wrist,,,liu_preliminary_2019,Preliminary Agreement on Tracking Sleep Between a Wrist-Worn Device Fitbit Alta and Consensus Sleep Diary,"Liu et al., 2019",China,,,1,,1,,,,,healthy young adults,healthy young adults,young adults,,,normative,,,n/a,n/a,10,Actigraphy,,,1,1,,,,Fitbit Alta,,,Fitbit,,,,,Fitbit software,Fitbit software,Automatic (heart rate + activity),,,,,,1,,,n/a,n/a,,"TST, SOL, WASO, SE, awakenings",,,,standard,,actigraphy-defined,,,,TST/TIB*100,,standard,1,1,1,1,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,n/a,,,consensus sleep diary,Consensus Sleep Diary,1,,,,,,,,,,7 nights,7,matched,1,,,TST/TIB*100,TIB-SOL-WASO-TWAK,TIB-SOL-WASO-TWAK,,,1,,LO-RT,direct question,direct question,direct question,n/a,0,,,,,,,,,,n/a,,,,,,n/a,not reported,,,,,,,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,n/a,wilcoxon signed rank tests to test differences between methods; bland altman plots,n/a,,,,,

The present study aims to investigate the ability of the two most commonly employed methods, actigraphy and sleep logs, to identify circadian sleep/wake disorders and measure changes in sleep patterns over time. In addition, the study assesses whether sleep measured by both methods shows the same relationship with an established circadian phase marker, urinary 6-sulphatoxymelatonin. A total of 49 registered blind subjects with different types of circadian rhythms were studied daily for at least four weeks. Grouped analysis of all study days for all subjects was performed for all sleep parameters (1062-1150 days data per sleep parameter). Good correlations were observed when comparing the measurement of sleep timing and duration (sleep onset, sleep offset, night sleep duration, day-time nap duration). However, the methods were poorly correlated in their assessment of transitions between sleep and wake states (sleep latency, number and duration of night awakenings, number of day-time naps). There were also large and inconsistent differences in the measurement of the absolute sleep parameters. Overall, actigraphs recorded a shorter sleep latency, advanced onset time, increased number and duration of night awakenings, delayed offset, increased night sleep duration and increased number and duration of naps compared with the subjective sleep logs. Despite this, there was good agreement between the methods for measuring changes in sleep patterns over time. In particular, the methods agreed when assessing changes in sleep in relation to a circadian phase marker (the 6-sulphatoxymelatonin (aMT6s) rhythm) in both entrained (n = 30) and free-running (n = 4) subjects.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,actimetry;article;circadian rhythm;clinical article;female;human;male;measurement;priority journal;sleep disorder/di [Diagnosis];*sleep pattern;urine level;6 hydroxymelatonin o sulfate/ec [Endogenous Compound];Sleep,,,lockley_comparison_1999,Comparison between subjective and actigraphic measurement of sleep and sleep rhythms,"Lockley et al., 1999",United Kingdom,,,1,,1,,,,,blind individuals,visual impairment,adults,,,visual impairment,,,n/a,n/a,49,Actigraphy,,,1,1,,,,Motionlogger,Mini Motionlogger,,not reported,,,,,Action 3,Action 3,sleep diaries,,1,,,,,,,n/a,n/a,,"TST, SOL, bedtime, waketime, awakenings, mean duration of awakenings, no. of naps, mean duration of naps",,,,standard,,actigraphy-defined,,,,,,standard,1,1,,,,1,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"mean duration of awakenings, no. of naps, mean duration of naps",nap variables,,"sleep diaries (mixed methods i.e., large print, audiotape, e-mail, braille)",generic,,,,,,,,,,,4 weeks,28,matched,1,,,not reported,calculated from TIB-SOL-WASO,TIB-SOL-WASO,,,1,,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,0,,,,,,,,,,n/a,,,,,,n/a,"pooled data, mean values",,1,,,,,,1,,1,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,n/a,"pearson correlations and t-tests to compare methods, for pooled data and mean values for each individual",n/a,,,,,

Method(s): Pre-treatment and post-treatment self-report measures of sleep were compared with those obtained from home-based polysomnography (PSG) in 60 adults (mean age = 69.17; 42 women) with comorbid insomnia. The self-report data were published previously in a randomized controlled trial demonstrating the efficacy of CBT-I compared with a placebo treatment. Result(s): Self-report measures significantly underestimated sleep at pre-treatment and CBT-I led to a correction in this discrepancy. There were no significant changes in PSG after CBT-I. Path analysis showed that an increase in an objective proxy measure of sleep quality (i.e., decreased stage N1 sleep) after CBT-I was significantly related to improvements in self-report of sleep, with full mediation by reductions in discrepancy. Conclusion(s): This is the first CBT-I outcome study to analyze discrepancy changes and demonstrate that these changes account for a significant portion of self-report outcome. In addition, improved sleep quality as measured by a decrease in percentage of stage N1 sleep following treatment may be one mechanism that explains why sleep estimation is more accurate following CBT-I.

Further, sleep discrepancy in insomnia with sleep comorbidities remains underexplored. We sought to better characterize sleep discrepancy among patient groups with and without insomnia and comorbid conditions such as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). METHOD(S): Using data from the Sleep Heart Health Study, we conducted a secondary analysis describing (1) the profile of self-reported and objective sleep measures in patients with insomnia (IS group; n = 73) and comorbid OSA (IS + OSA group; n = 143), compared with individuals with OSA only (OSA group; n = 296) and normal sleep control patients (NSC group; n = 126); (2) the comparative magnitude of sleep misperception between these 4 groups; and (3) the self-reported quality of life (QOL) in the 4 groups. RESULT(S): Subjective-objective sleep discrepancy existed in all 4 groups, including the NSC group. Controlling for age, sex, mental health conditions, sleep apnea severity, and objectively measured sleep time, the presence of self-reported insomnia had the strongest association with sleep discrepancy. In patients with insomnia, sleep onset latency was overestimated (7.8 +/- 36.8 min in the IS group; P < .001 when compared to the NSC and OSA groups), with the largest differences seen in the comorbid IS + OSA group (15.0 +/- 56.8 min). Insomnia conferred the most negative impact on QOL, with the combined IS + OSA group reporting the lowest QOL. CONCLUSION(S): Self-reported insomnia is associated with sleep discrepancy and negative QOL. Those with comorbid OSA reported the greatest sleep discrepancy and the lowest QOL. Future research is warranted to further understand individual profiles of misperception and insomnia phenotypes. CITATION: Ma Y, Goldstein MR, Davis RB, Yeh GY.

The aim of this retrospective study was to examine the association between Central Nervous System (i.e. EEG) and Autonomic Nervous System activity in the Sleep Onset Period and the first NREM sleep cycle in Primary Insomnia (n=. 17) and healthy controls (n=. 11). Furthermore, the study examined the influence of elevated EEG and Autonomic Nervous System activity on Stage2 sleep-protective mechanisms (K-complexes and sleep spindles). Confirming previous findings, the Primary Insomnia-group overestimated Sleep Onset Latency and this overestimation was correlated with elevated EEG activity. A higher amount of beta EEG activity during the Sleep Onset Period was correlated with the appearance of K-complexes immediately followed by a sleep spindle in the Primary Insomnia-group. This can be interpreted as an extra attempt to protect sleep continuity or as a failure of the sleep-protective role of the K-complex by fast EEG frequencies following within one second. The strong association found between K-alpha (K-complex within one second followed by 8-12. Hz EEG activity) in Stage2 sleep and a lower parasympathetic Autonomic Nervous System dominance (less high frequency HR) in Slow-wave sleep, further assumes a state of hyperarousal continuing through sleep in Primary Insomnia.

We conducted this study to determine whether alterations in objective sleep characteristics are associated with subjective measures of poor sleep quality in persons with CFS. Method(s): We examined the relationship between perceived sleep quality and polysomnographic measures of nighttime and daytime sleep in 35 people with CFS and 40 non-fatigued control subjects, identified from the general population of Wichita, Kansas and defined by empiric criteria. Perceived sleep quality and daytime sleepiness were assessed using clinical sleep questionnaires. Objective sleep characteristics were assessed by nocturnal polysomnography and daytime multiple sleep latency testing. Result(s): Participants with CFS reported unrefreshing sleep and problems sleeping during the preceding month significantly more often than did non-fatigued controls. Participants with CFS also rated their quality of sleep during the overnight sleep study as significantly worse than did control subjects. Control subjects reported significantly longer sleep onset latency than latency to fall asleep as measured by PSG and MSLT. There were no significant differences in sleep pathology or architecture between subjects with CFS and control subjects. Conclusion(s): People with CFS reported sleep problems significantly more often than control subjects. Yet, when measured these parameters and sleep architecture did not differ between the two subject groups. A unique finding requiring further study is that control, but not CFS subjects, significantly over reported sleep latency suggesting CFS subjects may have an increased appreciation of sleep behaviour that may contribute to their perception of sleep problems.

Mazza, HESPER Laboratory, Universite Lyon 1, Universite de Lyon, Lyon, France","In research and clinical contexts, parents' report and sleep diary filled in by parents are often used to characterize sleep-wake rhythms in children. The current study aimed to investigate children self-perception of their sleep, by comparing sleep diaries filled in by themselves, actigraphic sleep recordings, and parental subjective estimation. Eighty children aged 8-9 years wore actigraph wristwatches and completed sleep diaries for 7 days, while their parents completed a sleep-schedule questionnaire about their child' sleep. The level of agreement and correlation between sleep parameters derived from these three methods were measured. Sleep parameters were considered for the whole week and school days and weekends separately and a comparison between children with high and low sleep efficiency was carried out. Compared to actigraphy, children overestimated their sleep duration by 92 min and demonstrated significant difficulty to assess the amount of time they spent awake during the night. The estimations were better in children with high sleep efficiency compared to those with low sleep efficiency. Parents estimated that their children went to bed 36 min earlier and obtained 36.5 min more sleep than objective estimations with actigraphy. Children and parents' accuracy to estimate sleep parameters was different during school days and weekends, supporting the importance of analyzing separately school days and weekends when measuring sleep in children. Actigraphy and sleep diaries showed good agreement for bedtime and wake-up time, but not for SOL and WASO. A satisfactory agreement for TST was observed during school days only, but not during weekends. Even if parents provided more accurate sleep estimation than children, parents' report, and actigraphic data were weakly correlated and levels of agreement were insufficient. These results suggested that sleep diary completed by children provides interesting measures of self-perception, while actigraphy may provide additional information about nocturnal wake times. Sleep diary associated with actigraphy could be an interesting tool to evaluate parameters that could contribute to adjust subjective perception to objective sleep values.Â© Copyright Â© 2020 Mazza, Bastuji and Rey.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,*actimetry;article;child;child health;controlled study;female;human;male;school child;*sleep;sleep latency;*sleep pattern;sleep quality;sleep stage;sleep time;sleep waking cycle;wakefulness;Child;Only Child,,,mazza_objective_2020,"Objective and Subjective Assessments of Sleep in Children: Comparison of Actigraphy, Sleep Diary Completed by Children and Parents' Estimation","Mazza et al., 2020",France,,,1,,,,,,,children aged 8-9 years recruited from elementary schools,children,children,,,normative,,,38 high efficiency sleepers,38 low efficiency sleepers,76,Actigraphy,,,1,1,,,,Actiwatch 2,,,Actiware Medium (40),,,,,Actiware Sleep 6.0.9,Actiware,"event marker, activity, light",1,,1,1,,,,,n/a,n/a,,"TST, SOL, WASO, time at wake, bedtime",,,,standard,,actigraphy-defined,,,,,,,1,1,1,,,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,n/a,,,visual sleep diary,generic,,1,,,,,,,,,7 nights,7,matched,1,,,n/a,visual,visual,,,,1,visual,visual,visual,visual,n/a,0,,,,,,,,,,n/a,,,,,,n/a,mean values,,1,,,,,,,,1,1,,,,1,,,,,,,1,,,n/a,repeated measures ANOVA on each sleep parameter with measure (actigraphy vs sleep diary vs parent report) as between subject factor and study period (weekday vs weeknd) as within subject factor; pearson correlations between measures; bland altman plots for comparing measures; Pitmans test for the variability between measurements,n/a,,,,,

Method(s): Fifty-two middle-aged and older insomnia sufferers and 49 matched normal sleepers underwent multiple nights of laboratory and home polysomnography (PSG) and provided concurrent subjective estimates of their sleep. Descriptive statistics, cluster analyses, and inferential tests were used to examine the nature of sleep time perceptions, identify subgroups with distinctive patterns such as perceptions, and explore factors that may contribute to these subgroups' distinctive sleep perceptions. Result(s): Consistent with previous studies, the insomnia sufferers, as a group, showed a greater tendency to underestimate the time they slept than did the normal sleepers, but the accuracy of sleep time perceptions varied widely within each sample. Correlational analyses showed that study participants in each sample showed a moderate level of consistency in how accurately they estimated sleep time across nights. Subsequent cluster analyses conducted to identify subgroups with distinctive patterns of sleep time perceptions yielded four subgroups within the insomnia sample and three subgroups within the normal sleeper sample. Although the sleep setting significantly affected sleep perceptions for one insomnia subgroup, both laboratory and home objective-subjective sleep comparisons provided similar impressions regarding the relative accuracy of each subgroup's nocturnal sleep/wake perceptions. Finally, varying patterns of subgroup differences were noted across several common psychometric measures. Conclusion(s): The underestimation of sleep time is not a generic characteristic that separates all insomnia sufferers from normal sleepers. Sleep setting, personality traits, and perhaps constitutional factors appear to influence perceptions of sleep and wake time duration.

The two groups differed in 10 out of 13 questions about habitual sleep and daytime feelings. In contrast, polygraphic measures of baseline sleep indicated only that insomniacs tended to have slightly less total sleep and had a small but significant increase in early morning awakening time. Unlike the descriptions of habitual sleep, the subjects' retrospective reports of the previous night's sleep differed significantly only for the variable of total sleep time, and there were virtually no differences in the description of their status at a given moment. Auditory arousal thresholds were similar in the two groups, and both went back to sleep and stayed asleep with equal facility. These findings suggest that subjectively poor sleep is not necessarily 'light' sleep. For both groups, arousal thresholds differed across the sleep stages, and thresholds to hearing the subject's name were lower than those in response to electronic tones. Although insomniacs had as much polygraphically defined sleep as controls between the forced awakenings of the arousal threshold studies, they perceived their sleep to be only approximately half as long. Insomniacs described themselves as having been awake more frequently than controls in 8 out of 10 forced awakening situations. In one case, insomniacs also overestimated the time between awakenings. In both groups, there was little relationship between reported habitual aspects of sleep and baseline polygraphically defined sleep variables. On questionnaires the following mornings, however, in both groups there was a positive correlation of subjective quality of sleep on the baseline nights with percentage of rapid eye movement sleep, and a negative correlation to various aspects of slow-wave sleep.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,*arousal;central nervous system;clinical article;human;*insomnia;priority journal;*sleep;Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders,,,mendelson_1986,A psychophysiological study of insomnia,"Mendelson et al., 1986",USA,,,1,1,,,1,,,individuals with insomnia and age and sex matched controls,insomnia,adults,,,insomnia,,,10 individuals with insomnia,10 age and sex matched controls,20,PSG,1,1,,,,,,n/a,,,,,,,,n/a,n/a,n/a,,,,,,,,,R&K,in-lab,nocturnal,"TST, sleep after experimental awakenings, awake/asleep upon awakening (binary)",,,,standard,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,sleep after experimental awakenings,experiment-related,,"habitual sleep questionnaire, morning sleep questionnaire, post-experimental awakening questionnaire",generic,,,1,,,1,1,,,,6 nights entailing different experimental conditions,6,"habitual, matched",1,1,,n/a,n/a,,,,,,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,subjective sleep following experimental awakening/ objective sleep following experimental awakening,1,atypical,,,,,,,,subjective sleep following awakening/ objective sleep following awakening,0,,,1,,,ratio score,mean values,,1,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,n/a,"correlations (assume to be pearson correlations) between habitual self-report sleep and PSG, daily sleep self-report and PSG; chi-square for number of times individual reported being awake following awakening",n/a,,,,,

Recognizing sleep disturbances at an early stage of the disease progress is a first prerequisite of intervention and monitoring of progress. This study aimed to investigate the reliability of subjective sleep reports in early- and moderate-stage Alzheimer dementia (AD), by investigating whether they differ from matched healthy normal comparison groups with respect to the discrepancy of subjective and objective sleep estimates. MEASUREMENTS: : Subjective sleep was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, the Sleep Disorders Questionnaire, and the Athens Insomnia Scale. Objective sleep was estimated using actigraphy. RESULTS: : As compared with the normal comparison group (N = 26), AD patients (N = 55) complained less of insomnia, while their objective sleep estimates indicated, in fact, more disturbed sleep, including a longer sleep onset latency and a lower sleep efficiency. Regression analyses aimed at predicting actigraphic sleep parameter estimates from their subjective counterparts showed significant predictive value of only very few subjective sleep parameters. Subjective reports of both patients and the normal comparison group had significant value in predicting actigraphic indices of total sleep time and bedtime. In addition, subjective reports of the normal comparison group, but not of patients, were of value to predict actigraphic indices of sleep onset latency, average sleep bout duration, and sleep efficiency. CONCLUSION: : The results show that the value of sleep questionnaires is limited in early- and moderate-stage AD. Actigraphy may be essential to ensure that sleep problems do not go undetected and untreated.","research.

When chronic pain co-occurs with insomnia, sleep may be more fragmented, including more movement and arousals. However, individuals may not be consciously aware of these arousals. We examined the baseline concordance of diaries, actigraphy, and PSG as well as the ability of each assessment method to detect changes in sleep following cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I). Method(s): Adults with insomnia and fibromyalgia (n = 113) were randomized to CBT-I, CBT for pain, or waitlist control. At baseline and posttreatment, participants completed one night of PSG and two weeks of diaries/actigraphy. Result(s): At baseline, objective measures estimated lower SOL, higher TST, and higher SE than diaries (ps < 0.05). Compared to PSG, actigraphic estimates were higher for SOL and lower for WASO (ps < 0.05). Repeated measures ANOVAs were conducted for the CBT-I group (n = 15), and significant method by time interactions indicated that the assessment methods differed in their sensitivity to detect treatment-related changes. PSG values did not change significantly for any sleep parameters. However, diaries showed improvements in SOL, WASO, and SE, and actigraphy also detected the WASO and SE improvements (ps < 0.05). Conclusion(s): Actigraphy was generally more concordant with PSG than with diaries, which are the recommended assessment for diagnosing insomnia. However, actigraphy showed greater sensitivity to treatment-related changes than PSG; PSG failed to detect any improvements, but actigraphy demonstrated changes in WASO and SE, which were also found with diaries. In comorbid insomnia/fibromyalgia, actigraphy may therefore have utility in measuring treatment outcomes.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,*actimetry;adult;article;*assessment of humans;clinical assessment;clinical evaluation;*cognitive therapy;comorbidity;controlled study;correlation analysis;female;*fibromyalgia;follow up;human;*insomnia/di [Diagnosis];*insomnia/th [Therapy];major clinical study;male;pain;*polysomnography;sleep;sleep parameters;sleep time;treatment outcome;*sleep diary;sleep efficiency;sleep onset latency;total sleep time;wake time after sleep onset;Comorbidity;Fibromyalgia;Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders,,,mundt_measuring_2016,Measuring treatment outcomes in comorbid insomnia and fibromyalgia: concordance of subjective and objective assessments,"Mundt et al., 2016",USA,,,1,,,1,,1,,"adults with insomnia and fibromyalgia randomised to CBT-I, CBT for pain, or waitlist control",fibromyalgia and insomnia,adults,,,comorbid fibromyalgia and insomnia,fibromyalgia,insomnia,"39 CBT for insomnia, 37 CBT for pain",37 waitlist control,113,"Actigraphy, PSG",1,1,1,1,,,,Actiwatch 2,,,Actiware High (80),,,,,Actiware Sleep 5.3.2,Actiware,sleep diaries,,1,,,,,,,R&K,home-based,nocturnal,"TIB, TST, SOL, WASO, SE",,,,standard,,first 3 consecutive epochs of stage 1 or first epoch of any other sleep (R&K),,,,TST/TIB*100,,,1,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,n/a,,,sleep diary,generic,1,,,,,,,,,,"1 night (2 weeks actigraphy, diary)",1,matched,1,,,TST/TIB * 100,not reported,not reported,,,,,not reported,not reported,not reported,not reported,n/a,0,,,,,,,,,,n/a,,,,,,n/a,single night,,,1,,,,,,,1,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,n/a,"repeated measures ANOVA with method as within-subjects factor, pearson correlations between methods, repeated measures ANOVA with two within subjects factors (2 time-points, 3 methods) for CBT-I groups",n/a,,,,,

However, few studies have investigated sleep-state misperception in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). We designed this study to 1) delineate the factors that could affect this discrepancy and 2) infer an underlying mechanism in patients with OSA., METHODS: We recruited patients who visited our sleep clinic for the evaluation of their snoring and/or observed OSA. Participants completed a structured questionnaire and underwent overnight polysomnography. On the following day, five sessions of the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) were applied. We divided the patients into two groups: normal sleep perception and abnormal perception. The abnormal-perception group included patients whose perceived total sleep time was less than 80% of that measured in polysomnography., RESULTS: Fifty OSA patients were enrolled from a university hospital sleep clinic. Excessive daytime sleepiness, periodic limb movement index (PLMI), and the presence of dreaming were positively associated with poor sleep perception. REM sleep near the sleep termination exerted important effects. Respiratory disturbance parameters were not related to sleep perception. There was a prolongation in the sleep latency in the first session of the MSLT and we suspected that a delayed sleep phase occurred in poor-sleep perceivers., CONCLUSIONS: As an objectively good sleep does not match the subjective good-sleep perception in OSA, physicians should keep in mind that OSA patients who perceive that they have slept well does not mean that their OSA is less severe.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,"Polysomnography;Sleep Apnea Syndromes;Sleep Apnea, Obstructive;Apnea",,,nam_sleep_2016,Sleep Perception in Obstructive Sleep Apnea: A Study Using Polysomnography and the Multiple Sleep Latency Test,"Nam et al., 2016",Korea,,,,1,,,,,,patients referred to a sleep clinic for evaluation of snoring/ OSA,individuals referred for PSG,adults,,,referred for PSG,,,n/a,n/a,50,PSG,1,1,,,,,,n/a,,,,,,,,n/a,n/a,n/a,,,,,,,,,AASM,in-lab,nocturnal,TST,,,,standard,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,n/a,,,sleep diary,generic,1,,,,,,,,,,1 night,1,matched,1,,,n/a,direct question,question,,1,,,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,sTST/oTST*100 --> binary categorical,1,dTST,,,,,,,,,binary,,,1,,,ratio score to form groups ,single night,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,n/a,n/a,n/a,,,,,

This study's objective was to document sleep spindles characteristics in INS compared with GS and to investigate their potential role in sleep consolidation and misperception. Seventeen individuals with paradoxical insomnia (PARA-I), 24 individuals with psychophysiological insomnia (PSY-I), and 29 GS completed four consecutive polysomnographic nights in laboratory. Sleep spindles were detected automatically during stage 2 and SWS (3-4) on night 3. Number, density, duration, frequency, and amplitude of sleep spindles were calculated. A misperception index was used to determine the degree of discrepancy between subjective and objective total sleep times. Kruskal-Wallis H tests and post hoc tests revealed that PARA-I had significantly shorter sleep spindles than GS but that PSY-I and GS did not differ on spindles length. A standard multiple regression model revealed that neither sleep spindles characteristics nor objective sleep measures were predictive of sleep misperception. A longer duration of spindles could reflect a higher gating process but this hypothesis still needs to be confirmed in replication studies.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,Adult;Electroencephalography/mt [Methods];Female;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;*Perception/ph [Physiology];*Sleep/ph [Physiology];*Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders/pp [Physiopathology];Time Factors;Wakefulness;Young Adult;Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders;Sleep,,,normand_sleep_2016,Sleep Spindles Characteristics in Insomnia Sufferers and Their Relationship with Sleep Misperception,"Normand et al., 2016",Canada,,,,1,,,,,,"paradoxical insomnia, psychophysiological insomnia, good sleepers",psychophysiological insomnia; paradoxical insomnia,adults,,,psychophysiological insomnia,paradoxical insomnia,,"17 paradoxical insomnia, 24 psychophysiological insomnia",29 good sleeers,70,PSG,1,1,,,,,,n/a,,,,,,,,n/a,n/a,n/a,,,,,,,,,R&K,in-lab,nocturnal,TST,,,,standard,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,n/a,,,sleep diary,generic,1,,,,,,,,,,4 nights (1 night used for recording),1,matched,1,,,TST/TIB * 100,calculated from TIB-TWT,TIB-TWT,,,1,,LO-RT,direct question,direct question,direct question,(oTST-sTST)/oTST,1,MI,,,,,,,,,0,,,,1,,Misperception index,single night,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,n/a,n/a,n/a,,,,,

Method(s): Seventy-five patients with FMS completed a 7-day home assessment protocol. They wore an actigraphic device at all times. In the morning, they used the electronic diary to record the subjective report of sleep from the previous night and current severity of the FMS-related symptoms. Result(s): On average, the 2 assessment methods yielded a 73 absolute minute difference per night per patient. About half of the nights, sleep duration was underestimated. Approximately 20% of the nights had greater than 2-hour difference between the 2 methods. Factors related to this large discrepancy were (1) objective indicator of restless sleep, (2) subjective report of difficulty falling asleep, and (3) report of fatigue at the time of reporting. FMS-related symptoms were related to subjective report of poor sleep but not to objective sleep data. DISCUSSION: Misestimation of sleep seems common in FMS patients, particularly when their sleep quality is poor. Careful considerations for evaluating the severity of patients sleep complaints are critical in adequate management of sleep disturbance that is commonly reported by FMS patients.

The eight-item Patient Health Questionnaire was used to ascertain participants' depression status. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index was used to define subjective, or perceived, sleep quality. Wrist-worn actigraph monitors, worn for seven consecutive nights, were used to characterize objective sleep quality and disturbances. Interviewer-administered questionnaires were used to collect information on sociodemographic and lifestyle factors. Linear regression models were fit using continuous sleep parameters as the dependent variables and depression status as the independent variable. Multivariable models were adjusted for body mass index, marital status, smoking status, education level, and children's disabilities., RESULTS: Using an eight-item Patient Health Questionnaire score >=10, 26.3% of participants presented with depression. Depressed women were more likely to self-report overall poorer (subjective) sleep compared to non-depressed women; however, differences in sleep were not consistently noted using actigraphic (objective) sleep traits. Among the depressed, both sleep duration and total time in bed were significantly underestimated. In multivariable models, depression was negatively associated with sleep duration using both subjective (beta=-0.71, standard error [SE] =0.25; P=0.006) and objective sleep (beta=-0.42, SE =0.19; P=0.026)., CONCLUSION: The association between sleep and depression differed comparing subjective and objective methods of assessment.

Subjective measures of insomnia were obtained from a sleep diary (morning questionnaire), and objective measures from two nights of polysomnography (PSG)., RESULTS: All subjective measures of sleep revealed significant sleep disturbance in the TBI group. TBI patients with insomnia have a tendency to overestimate their sleep disturbance compared to PSG measures of sleep. With PSG, 10 out of 14 participants with TBI could be defined as having objective insomnia. Nonetheless, when groups were compared, no significant differences were found on sleep continuity variables, although large effect sizes were seen for several measures suggesting sleep fragmentation. In terms of sleep architecture, no significant differences were found in the percentage of stage 2, slow-wave (stages 3 and 4), and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, but a higher proportion of stage 1 sleep was found in the TBI participants. When patients using psychotropic medication were excluded, TBI patients were found to have more awakenings lasting longer than 5min and a shorter REM sleep latency., CONCLUSIONS: These results are similar to those found in patients with either primary insomnia or insomnia related to depression.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,"Adult;*Brain Injuries/co [Complications];Brain Injuries/ep [Epidemiology];Demography;Disability Evaluation;Electroencephalography;Electromyography;Female;Glasgow Coma Scale;Humans;Male;Polysomnography;*Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders/di [Diagnosis];Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders/ep [Epidemiology];*Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders/et [Etiology];Sleep Stages/ph [Physiology];Sleep, REM/ph [Physiology];Surveys and Questionnaires;Brain;Brain Injuries;Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders",,,ouellet_subjective_2006,Subjective and objective measures of insomnia in the context of traumatic brain injury: a preliminary study,"Ouellet & Morin, 2006",Canada,,,1,,,,,,,patients with mild to severe traumatic brain injury and healthy good sleepers,traumatic brain injury,adults,,,traumatic brain injury,,,14 patients with mild to severe traumatic brain injury, 14 healthy good sleepers,28,PSG,1,1,,,,,,n/a,,,,,,,,n/a,n/a,n/a,,,,,,,,,R&K,in-lab,nocturnal,"SOL, WASO",,,,,,first epoch Stage 2,,,,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,n/a,,,morning questionnaire,generic,,,1,,,,,,,,2 nights (2nd night used for analysis),1,matched,1,,,n/a,direct question,question,,1,,,LO-RT,direct question,direct question,direct question,n/a,0,,,,,,,,,,n/a,,,,,,n/a,single night,,,1,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,n/a,comparisons between methods by Wilcoxon signed rank tests for TBI group and control group,n/a,,,,,

Alpha activity was not associated with increased memory for auditory stimuli presented during sleep, sleep state misperception, or with myalgia symptoms.

A secondary aim was to find if self-reported sleep showed expected correlations with hyperarousal (Hyperarousal Scale). Design(s): Drug trial baseline data from 88 healthy, postmenopausal women were retrospectively analyzed. Multivariate regression was used to adjust for confounder variables and test whether differences in self-reported sleep measures were systematically associated with differences in objective sleep, WHQ symptom measures, or cognitive test performance scores. Result(s): Increased self-report scores for low sleep quality were associated with an increased risk of WHQ symptoms and reduced cognitive test performance. Self-reported sleep measures showed little correlation with their analogous objective measures. Self-reported low sleep quality proved most closely associated with the WHQ symptoms of tiredness, clumsiness, and difficulty concentrating. Women whose self-reported sleep-onset latency times were longer than the median over-estimated their objective sleep onset time by 30 min, whereas the other women underestimated theirs by 15 min (P < 0.0001 ). Women whose self-reported total sleep was longer or shorter than the median, respectively, underestimated objective sleep times by 9 and 71 min (P < 0.0001). High hyperarousal scores were associated with underestimations of objective sleep. Conclusion(s): Self-reports of lower sleep quality were associated with increased WHQ psychological and somatic symptom measures and decreased cognitive test performance more than with differences in objective sleep. Self-reported trouble sleeping may signal problems independent from objectively low sleep quality, such as subjective distress or diminished cognitive function.

To test the hypothesis that patients with bipolar disorder display a systematic bias to underestimate sleep duration and overestimate sleep latency. Methods. Actimetry was used to assess sleep latency and duration in 49 euthymic participants (bipolar = 21; healthy controls = 28) for 5-7 days. Participants simultaneously recorded estimated sleep duration and sleep latency on a daily basis via an online sleep diary. Group differences in the discrepancy between subjective and objective parameters were calculated using t-tests and corrected for multiple comparisons. Results. Patients with bipolar disorder significantly underestimated their sleep duration but did not overestimate their sleep latency compared to healthy controls. Conclusions. Studies utilizing diaries or questionnaires alone in patients with bipolar disorders may systematically underestimate sleep duration compared to healthy controls. The additional use of objective assessment methods such as actimetry is advisable.Copyright Â© 2016 Philipp S.

The mean age of the patients was 56.9 years, and the mean duration of insomnia morbidity was 8.9 years. Each received individual combined CBT treatments consisting of stimulus control, sleep reduction, cognitive therapy and sleep hygiene education over a period of 1 month. Method(s): Just before the CBT and after its completion, sleep measurements were conducted that involved (i) sleep logs, Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep Scale (DBAS), and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI); (ii) actigraphy measurement; (iii) dissociation between subjective and objective evaluation of sleep calculated from sleep logs and actigraphy results; and (iv) correlation between DBAS and the aforementioned sleep parameters. Because the intention was to focus on patients' incorrect cognition about sleep, the definition 'changes in dissociation between the sleep log and actigraphically measured sleep' was used as the primary outcome and 'changes in DBAS score' as the secondary outcome. Result(s): After the CBT the following was found: (i) underestimation by PPI patients of the objective evaluation of sleep; (ii) a decrease in the dissociation between the subjective and objective evaluation of sleep; (iii) improvement of the DBAS; and (iv) improvement of sleep logs and actigraphy measurements. Moreover, there was a correlation between the improvement of PSQI, sleep logs and DBAS. Conclusion(s): CBT for insomnia is able to redress incorrect cognition about sleep, leading to improvement of the disorder.

E-mail: ksharkey@lifespan.org","Objectives: Comparisons of subjective and objective sleep measures have shown discrepancies between reported sleep and polysomnography (PSG) in non-drug dependent individuals with and without insomnia. Sleep may affect behavioral and physiologic aspects of drug abuse and dependence; patients in methadone maintenance therapy (MMT) for opioid dependence frequently report sleep problems. Whether subjective sleep reflects objective sleep in MMT patients is unknown. We undertook these analyses to establish the correlations among subjective and objective sleep measures in MMT patients. Method(s): We compared one week of daily sleep diaries, one night of home PSG, a questionnaire completed the morning after PSG, and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Inventory (PSQI) as well as demographics and drug use measures in 62 MMT patients with disturbed sleep (PSQI score > 5). Result(s): Subjective and objective sleep durations were similar in this sample; average sleep times for the diary, morning questionnaire, and PSG were 340, 323, and 332. min, respectively. Average diary sleep time, subjective ratings of feeling rested, and PSG sleep efficiency were correlated significantly with PSQI score. Age was inversely correlated with PSG sleep time. Participants whose urine toxicology showed benzodiazapine use reported significantly longer sleep times on the morning questionnaire. Conclusion(s): Objective sleep measures confirm subjective measures in MMT patients with disturbed sleep.

The aim of the present study was to examine the relationships between pre-sleep cognitive arousal and sleep misperception. Sixteen healthy sleepers participated in this naturalistic, observational study. Three nights of sleep were measured using actigraphy, and each 15-s epoch was classified as sleep or wake. Bedside noise was recorded, and each 15-s segment was classified as containing noise or no noise and matched to actigraphy. Participants completed measures of habitual pre-sleep cognitive and somatic arousal and noise sensitivity. Pre-sleep cognitive and somatic arousal levels were negatively associated with subjective-objective total sleep time discrepancy (p < 0.01). There was an association between sleep/wake and noise presence/absence in the first and last 90 min of sleep (p < 0.001). These results indicate that higher levels of habitual pre-sleep arousal are associated with a greater degree of sleep misperception, and even in healthy sleepers, objective sleep is vulnerable to habitual bedside noise.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,"Arousal;Habituation, Psychophysiologic",,,sharman_presleep_2022,Pre-Sleep Cognitive Arousal Is Negatively Associated with Sleep Misperception in Healthy Sleepers during Habitual Environmental Noise Exposure: An Actigraphy Study,"Sharman et al., 2022",United Kingdom,,,,1,,,,,,healthy sleepers,healthy adults,adults,,,normative,,,n/a,n/a,16,Actigraphy,,,1,1,,,,Actiwatch AW4,,,Actiware Medium (40),,,,,Actiwatch Activity and Sleep Analysis,Actiwatch Activity and Sleep Analysis,"event markers --> sleep diary, verification from audio file timestamps",1,1,,,,,,Audiofile timestamps,n/a,n/a,,TST,,,,standard,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,n/a,,,conensus sleep diary,Consensus Sleep Diary,1,,,,,,,,,,1 night,1,matched,1,,,TST/TIB * 100,TIB-SOL-WASO-TWAK,TIB-SOL-WASO-TWAK,,,1,,LO-RT,direct question,direct question,direct question,(sTST/oTST)*100,1,rTST100,,,,,,,,,0,,,1,,,"ratio score (OSE Edinger & Fins, 1995)",mean values,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,n/a,n/a,n/a,,,,,

This study compared sleep times from polysomnography (PSG) with self-reports of habitual sleep and sleep estimated on the morning after a PSG in adults. Design(s): Total sleep time and sleep onset latency obtained from unattended home PSGs were compared to sleep times obtained from a questionnaire completed before the PSG and a Morning Survey completed the morning after the PSG. Participant(s): A total of 2,113 subjects who were >= 40 years of age were included in this analysis. Measures and Results: Subjects were 53% female, 75% Caucasian, and 38% obese. The mean habitual sleep time (HABTST), morning estimated sleep time (AMTST), and PSG total sleep times (PSGTST) were 422 min, 379 min, and 363 min, respectively. The mean habitual sleep onset latency, morning estimated sleep onset latency, and PSG sleep onset latency were 17.0 min, 21.8 min, and 16.9 min, respectively. Models adjusting for related demographic factors showed that HABTST and AMTST differ significantly from PSGTST by 61 and 18 minutes, respectively. Obese and higher educated people reported less sleep time than their counterparts. Similarly, small but significant differences were seen for sleep latency. Conclusion(s): In a community population, self-reported total sleep times and sleep latencies are overestimated even on the morning following overnight PSG.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,adult;aged;alcohol consumption;article;body mass;controlled study;demography;ethnicity;female;human;linear regression analysis;male;measurement;obesity;*polysomnography;screening;sex difference;*sleep,,,silva_relationship_2007,Relationship between reported and measured sleep times: The Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS),"Silva et al., 2007",USA,,,1,,,,,,,participants over 40,healthy adults,adults,,,normative,,,n/a,n/a,2113,PSG,1,1,,,,,,n/a,,,,,,,,n/a,n/a,n/a,,,,,,,,,R&K,home-based,nocturnal,"TST, SOL",,,,standard,,first 3 consecutive epochs of stage 1 or first epoch of any other sleep (R&K),,,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,n/a,,,"morning questionnaire, SHSS Sleep Habits Questionnaire",SHSS Sleep Habits Questionnaire,1,,,,,1,,,,,1 night,1,"habitual, matched",1,1,,n/a,direct question,question,,1,,,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,0,,,,,,,,,,n/a,,,,,,n/a,single night,,,1,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,n/a,"pearson correlations between the three sleep measures, habitual, morning estimated, and PSG; mixed-effects linear regressions  predicting TST or SOL with method (PSG, habitual, morning) as a within-subjects factor and demographic and medical variables as covariates, participant and sleep centre fitted as random effects",n/a,,,,,

Some physical activity monitors (PAMs) provide data about sleep quality for the user, but there are scarce data concerning validity and usability of these measurements. This study compared the data of sleep parameters generated by a PAM with the polysomnography (PSG)., METHODS: In 2016, data of 26 patients in two consecutive PSGs as well as in two daytime and nighttime measurements with a PAM according to physical activity and sleep quality were collected. Furthermore, sleep quality, using the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI), daytime fatigue, using the multidimensional fatigue inventory (MFI-20) and additionally data of a sleep diary were collected., RESULTS: There were positive correlations of both methods with respect to total sleep time (TST) (r = 0.76, P < 0.01) and sleep efficiency (r = 0.71, P < 0.01). Data analysis over two nights showed that over 90% of the TST (95% confidence interval (CI) -1.59 to 0.82) and of the sleep efficiency (95% CI -8.28 to 15.51) were within the limits of agreement. The analysis of the PSQI and the sleep efficiency of the PAM showed no significant correlations. The daytime fatigue correlated negatively with the physical activity (r = -0.72, P < 0.01)., CONCLUSION: The sleep efficiency and TST measured with the PAM sufficiently reflect the PSG sleep parameters and the subjects' subjective feelings. At the same time, PAM results are also correlated with the subjectively perceived quality of sleep. Further investigations to assess the long-term results are pending.

To learn to predict who would qualify for our studies, we compared 30 laboratory-qualified poor sleepers (QPS) with 30 laboratory-disqualified poor sleepers (DPSs) on subjective report, mood, and all-night sleep laboratory variables. QPSs had significantly lower sleep efficiency and total sleep time in the laboratory, but these differences were due to the longer sleep latencies (50.7 +/- 27.8 min vs. 15.2 +/- 6.1 min) of the QPS group. QPSs and DPSs differed significantly in their morning estimates of their laboratory sleep latencies; as a group, QPSs gave an accurate estimate (51.6 +/- 27.8 min), but DPSs were significantly more likely to exaggerate their sleep latencies. Although we did not identify ways of predicting which poor sleepers would show sleep-onset insomnia in the sleep laboratory, we did find that, in this young, healthy population, there are poor sleepers who give an accurate report of a rather severe sleep-onset insomnia.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,adult;article;electroencephalography;heart rate;human;*insomnia/di [Diagnosis];male;pathophysiology;psychological aspect;reaction time,,,spinweber_disqualified_1985,Disqualified and qualified poor sleepers: subjective and objective variables,"Spinweber et al., 1985",USA,,,,1,,,,,,laboratory-qualified poor sleepers laboratory-disqualified poor sleepers who were male students at a naval school,men; tertiary students,young adults,,men,normative,,,laboratory disqualified poor sleepers,laboratory qualified poor sleepers,60,PSG,1,1,,,,,,n/a,,,,,,,,n/a,n/a,n/a,,,,,,,,,R&K,in-lab,nocturnal,"SOL, TST, awakenings (stats for these last two not reported)",,,,standard,,first epoch Stage 2,,,,,,standard,1,1,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,n/a,,,morning questionnaire,generic,,,1,,,,,,,,1 night,1,matched,1,,,n/a,direct question,question,,1,,,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,difference score (not reported) --> binary categorical,1,not reported,,,,,,,,,binary,1,,,,,algebraic difference score --> categorical variable,single night,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,n/a,n/a,n/a,,,,,

At present, a condition of underestimation of sleep is classified as paradoxical insomnia. Overestimation of sleep has also been reported in the past, with no clear reference to corresponding polysomnographic (PSG) findings or its clinical significance. Patients and Methods: Patients were recruited from the general population undergoing a PSG assessment for a cross-sectional retrospective study in a sleep clinic affiliated with a tertiary health center. Result(s): A group of patients who overestimated their sleep had mostly non-discriminating PSG findings when compared to patients who underestimated their sleep, and correct estimators. The only parameters that were significantly different were objective sleep duration and efficiency, and, importantly, respective multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) results. The patients who overestimated their sleep had a mean MSLT result of 7.8 min, which indicates moderate daytime sleepiness. Patients who underestimated their sleep and correct estimators had the respective MSLT results of >10 min, making a statistically significant difference. Conclusion(s): The authors identified a condition opposite the previously described sleep underestimation, and named it 'positive sleep state misperception' (PSSM). The condition is characterised by a gross overestimation of sleep. Inadequate sleep results in a clinically significant excessive daytime sleepiness, which patients were not able to predict. The authors propose a new model that incorporates both ends of the sleep misperception spectrum. Â© 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The results revealed a strong agreement between two methods for recording sleep offset times, but a relatively poor agreement for parameters that include substantial periods of transition between sleep and wake states. Overall, self-reported sleep durations were substantially longer than actigraphic estimates (mean bias of -30.6 min; limits of agreement -95.9 to 34.8 min), and the discrepancy was mainly caused by differences in two methods to track sleep onset latency and Wake-up After Sleep Onset (WASO). Based on a customised activity log, a strong positive correlation (rho = 0.75, p < .001) between self-report and actigraphy was observed for sleep duration estimates, which confirmed the effectiveness of the activity log in field studies.

Much of this research is based on subjective reports from trauma survivors; however, objective measures of sleep-related impairment have yielded findings inconsistent with self-report data. More studies investigating subjective and objective assessments concordantly are needed to understand sleep impairment in PTSD. The current study examined PTSD-related sleep disturbance in a female interpersonal violence cohort with full PTSD diagnoses (N=51) assessing subjective (global and daily diary measures) and objective (actigraphy) sleep measures concurrently. PTSD severity was positively associated with global, subjective reports of sleep impairment and insomnia. Subjective measures of sleep (including global sleep impairment, insomnia, and daily sleep diary reports of total sleep time, sleep efficiency, and sleep onset latency) were moderately to strongly correlated. However, no significant correlations between subjective and objective reports of sleep impairment were found in this cohort. Analyses demonstrated an overall elevation in subjectively reported sleep impairment when compared to objective measurement assessed concurrently.

Age is associated with decreased sleep EEG activity; however, the PSA of young adults is currently limited. Thus, this study aimed to examine the correlation of spectral EEG power with total sleep time (TST) misperception in young patients. Method(s): Forty-seven young adults were recruited and underwent a polysomnography recording in a sleep laboratory. Clinical records and self-report questionnaires of all patients were collected, and were used to categorize patients into a good sleeper (GS) group (n = 10), insomnia with a low mismatch group (IWLM, n = 19) or participant with a high mismatch group (IWHM, n = 18). PSA was applied to the first 6 h of sleep. Result(s): IWHM patients exhibited a higher absolute power and relative beta/delta ratio in the frontal region compared to the GS group. No significant difference was observed between the IWLM and GS groups. No significant difference in the above parameters was observed between the IWHM and IWLM groups. Moreover, The SOD of TST was positively correlated with frontal absolute power and the relative beta/delta ratio (r = 0.363, P = 0.012; r = 0.363, P = 0.012), and absolute beta EEG spectral power (r = 0.313, P = 0.032) as well as the number of arousals. Conclusion(s): Increased frontal beta/delta ratio EEG power was found in young patients with a high mismatch but not in those with a low mismatch, compared with good sleepers. This suggests that there exists increased cortical activity in IWHM patients. In addition, the frontal beta/delta ratio and the number of arousals was positively correlated with the SOD of TST.Copyright Â© 2022, The Author(s).","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,adult;arousal;article;brain region;clinical article;controlled study;*electroencephalogram;female;human;insomnia/di [Diagnosis];male;medical record;patient care;patient participation;*perception;Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index;polysomnography;self report;*sleep time;structured questionnaire;Symptom Checklist 90;Electroencephalography,,,xu_sleep_2022,Sleep EEG characteristics associated with total sleep time misperception in young adults: an exploratory study,"Xu et al., 2022",China,,,,1,,,,,,young adults,young adults,young adults,,,normative,,,n/a,n/a,47,PSG,1,1,,,,,,n/a,,,,,,,,n/a,n/a,n/a,,,,,,,,,AASM,in-lab,nocturnal,TST,,,,standard,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,n/a,,,morning questionnaire,generic,,,1,,,,,,,,1 night,1,matched,1,,,n/a,direct question,question,,1,,,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,sTST-oTST,1,dTST,,,,,,,,,0,1,,,,,algebraic difference score,single night,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,n/a,n/a,n/a,,,,,

However, subjective reports may be unreliable, and possibly may vary by the method of inquiry. We investigated this possibility by comparing within-individual response to direct versus indirect time queries after overnight polysomnography. METHODS: We obtained self-reported sleep-wake times via morning questionnaires in 879 consecutive adult diagnostic polysomnograms. Responses were compared within subjects (direct versus indirect query) and across groups defined by apnea-hypopnea index and by self-reported insomnia symptoms in pre-sleep questionnaires. Direct queries required a time duration response, while indirect queries required clock times from which we calculated time durations. RESULTS: Direct and indirect queries of sleep latency were the same in only 41% of cases, and total sleep time queries matched in only 5.4%. For both latency and total sleep, the most common discrepancy involved the indirect value being larger than the direct response. The discrepancy between direct and indirect queries was not related to objective sleep metrics. The degree of discrepancy was not related to the presence of insomnia symptoms, although patients reporting insomnia symptoms showed underestimation of total sleep duration by direct response. CONCLUSIONS: Self-reported sleep latency and total sleep time are often internally inconsistent when comparing direct and indirect survey queries of each measure. These discrepancies represent substantive challenges to effective clinical practice, particularly when diagnosis and management depends on self-reported sleep patterns, as with insomnia. Although self-reported sleep-wake times remains fundamental to clinical practice, objective measures provide clinically relevant adjunctive information.","Blind Peer Reviewed; Editorial Board Reviewed; Peer Reviewed; USA.

To determine the accuracy of sleep duration perception, we investigated 44 healthy subjects participating in multi-day inpatient sleep protocols during which they had extended nighttime and short daytime sleep opportunities but no time cues or knowledge of time of day. METHODS: The first sleep opportunity was at habitual sleep time and duration. The subsequent 3, 4, or 11 days had 12-h nighttime sleep opportunities and 4-h daytime nap opportunities, potentially creating an experimentally induced 'insomnia' with substantial time awake during scheduled sleep. RESULTS: Subjective sleep duration estimates were accurate for the first (habitual) sleep opportunity. The subjective reports following nighttime 12-h sleep opportunities significantly underestimated objective sleep duration, while those following daytime 4-h sleep opportunities significantly overestimated objective sleep duration. Misperception errors were not explained by poor sleep efficiency, which was lower during 4-h ( 39%) than 12-h opportunities ( 71%). Subjective sleep estimates after 4-h opportunities correlated with the percentage of REM and N3 sleep. Subjective sleep estimates following 12-h opportunities were, unexpectedly, negatively correlated with NREM stage 2 sleep. CONCLUSION: The estimation of sleep duration in the absence of time cues may depend on length of sleep opportunity and/or time of day. The results have implications for understanding sleep state misperception, which is an important consideration in patients with insomnia. CITATION: Bianchi MT; Wang W; Klerman EB.

It is thought to operate by eliminating voluntary sleep effort, thereby ameliorating sleep performance anxiety, an aroused state incompatible with sleep. However, this remains untested. Moreover, few PI studies have employed objective sleep measures. The present study therefore examined the effect of PI on sleep effort, sleep anxiety and both objective and subjective sleep. Following a seven-night baseline, 34 sleep-onset insomniacs were randomly allocated to 14 nights of PI, or to a control (no PI) condition. Consistent with the performance anxiety model, participants allocated to PI, relative to controls, showed a significant reduction in sleep effort, and sleep performance anxiety. Sleep-onset latency (SOL) differences between PI participants and controls using an objective sleep measure were not observed, although an underlying trend for significantly lowered subjective SOL amongst PI participants was demonstrated. This may relate to actigraphic insensitivity, or more probably confirms recent suggestions that insomniacs readily overestimate sleep deficit, due to excessive anxiety about sleep. Together, results help determine putative mechanisms underlying PI, have important implications for the clinical application of PI, and emphasize the need for further PI research within an experimental cognitive framework.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,*actimetry;adult;anxiety;arousal;article;behavior therapy;clinical article;*cognitive therapy;controlled study;female;human;*insomnia/di [Diagnosis];*insomnia/th [Therapy];male;model;priority journal;psychologic test;*sleep;*objective sleep;*paradoxical intention;sleep anxiety scale;sleep deficit/di [Diagnosis];sleep onset latency;sleep performance anxiety;sleep performance anxiety questionnaire;*subjective sleep;Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders,,,broomfield_initial_2003,Initial insomnia and paradoxical intention: An experimental investigation of putative mechanisms using subjective and actigraphic measurement of sleep,"Broomfield & Espie, 2003",United Kingdom,,,1,,,,1,,,individuals complaining of sleep-onset insomnia,insomnia,adults,,,insomnia,,,17 randomly allocated to paradoxical intention treatment,17 randomly allocated to control condition,34,Actigraphy,,,1,1,,,,Actiwatch 2,,,not reported,,,1,,not reported,not reported,event markers,1,,,,,,,,n/a,n/a,,"SOL, SE",,,,standard,,actigraphy-defined,,,,TST/TIB*100,,,,1,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,n/a,,,sleep diary,generic,1,,,,,,,,,,21 nights (experimental condition for experimental group during last 14),21,matched,1,,,not reported,direct question,question,,1,,,not reported,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,0,,,,,,,,,,n/a,,,,,,n/a,mean values,,1,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,n/a,pearson correlations between methods for sleep variables,n/a,,,,,

The primary purpose of our study was to assess the prevalence of insufficient sleep in collegiate athletes, with a secondary aim to compare male and female athletes. PROCEDURES: Participants included 121 collegiate athletes (65 men and 56 women) from six team sports and three individual sports. Subjective assessments of sleep included at-home sleep diary, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). Objective assessments of sleep included three consecutive off-season weekdays of wrist actigraphy to assess total sleep time (TST) and sleep efficiency (SE). MAIN FINDINGS: Actigraphy revealed that 94% of student-athletes received <8 hours of sleep/night, while 61% received <7 hours/night. Subjective assessments revealed that 35% had PSQI >5, 28% had ISI scores >7, and 19% had ESS scores >10. Objective TST was not different between sexes (6.7+/-0.1 vs. 6.7+/-0.1 hours, P = .99), but females demonstrated higher SE (87+/-1 vs. 82+/-1%, P < .01) and lower WASO (31+/-2 vs. 38+/-2 min, P = .02). Male athletes significantly overestimated TST (i.e., subjective minus objective TST) when compared to female athletes (DELTA0.7+/-0.1 vs. DELTA0.3+/-0.1 hours/night; P < .01). PSQI, ISI, and ESS were not different between sexes. CONCLUSION(S): The majority of male and female collegiate athletes received less than age-recommended levels of sleep, and 44% subjectively reported poor sleep quality, mild severity insomnia, and/or excessive daytime sleepiness.

Patients were classified into High Misperception (HM) and Moderate Misperception (MM) groups, according to the complement of the ratio between self-reported total sleep time and objective total sleep time (Misperception Index)., RESULTS: No significant differences emerged in any of the psychopathological measures considered between the HM and the MM group. Similarly, no effect was observed in quantitative estimation abilities. HM patients displayed a significantly increased number of awakenings per hour of sleep and a reduced dream recall rate. Their overall sleep quality and quality of life was significantly impaired., CONCLUSIONS: Future research on sleep misperception should focus on factors other than the level of psychopathology and estimation abilities, in particular sleep microstructure and quantitative EEG studies in both REM and NREM sleep.

Electronic address: mtbianchi@partners.org.","Objective: Insomnia is commonly co-morbid with obstructive sleep apnea. Among patients reporting insomnia symptoms, sleep misperception occurs when self-reported sleep duration under-estimates objective measures. Misperception represents a clinical challenge since insomnia management is based entirely on patient self-report. We tested the hypothesis that misperception occurring in sleep apnea patients would improve with subsequent treatment.Methods: We compared subjective sleep-wake reports with objective sleep in adults with obstructive sleep apnea (n=405) in two nights of polysomnography (diagnostic and treatment) within a median interval of 92 days.Results: Sleep latency was generally over-estimated, while wake after sleep onset and number of awakenings were under-estimated. None of these estimations differed between diagnostic and treatment polysomnograms. We observed a large spectrum of total sleep time misperception values during the diagnostic polysomnogram, with one third of the cohort under-estimating their total sleep time by at least 60 min. Of those with >60 minute misperception, we observed improved total sleep time perception during treatment polysomnography. Improved perception correlated with improvements in self-reported sleep quality and response confidence. We found no polysomnogram or demographic predictors of total sleep time misperception for the diagnostic polysomnogram, nor did we find objective correlates of improved perception during titration.Conclusion: Our results suggest that misperception may improve with treatment of obstructive sleep apnea in patients who also exhibit misperception. Within subject changes in misperception are consistent with misperception being, at least to some extent, a state characteristic, which has implications for management of patients with comorbid insomnia and sleep apnea.","research.

Observing that some patients evaluated for suspected hypersomnolence complain of insomnia and others fail to report that they are sleepy, we wondered whether overestimation of sleep latency could be occurring in these subjects as well. Since polysomnography (PSG) only provides one sleep onset with which to assess a patient's estimation, we investigated the use of the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) for this purpose. Among 147 patients who had an MSLT, 137 of whom had a preceding PSG, overestimation of sleep latency occurred on 78% and 74% of the respective tests. The magnitude of overestimation averaged 3 minutes and 27 minutes, respectively, and was not dependent on diagnosis. Subjects who had reported a history of difficulty falling asleep, compared to those who did not, tended to show equivalent objective sleep latencies, longer subjective nocturnal sleep latencies and less overall accuracy in their estimates. Those who denied having a problem with excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) showed objective sleep latencies nearly identical to those who complained of EDS but had only a trend toward higher overestimation on the MSLT. Overestimation of sleep latency is therefore more readily part of an explanation for why hypersomnolent patients sometimes complain of insomnia than it is for failure to recognize EDS. The MSLT as well as nocturnal recordings can provide data with which to assess overestimation of sleep latency.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,accuracy;adult;airway resistance;article;female;human;insomnia;major clinical study;male;narcolepsy;night sleep;polysomnography;priority journal;reliability;sleep apnea syndrome;*somnolence/di [Diagnosis];Disorders of Excessive Somnolence,,,chervin_overestimation_1996,Overestimation of sleep latency by patients with suspected hypersomnolence,"Chervin & Guilleminault, 1996",USA,,,1,,,,,,,patients referred to a sleep centre for an MSLT for suspected excessive daytime somnolence,excessive daytime somnolence,adults,,,excessive daytime somnolence,,,n/a,n/a,147,"PSG (Nocturnal, MSLT)",1,1,,,,,,n/a,,,,,,,,n/a,n/a,n/a,,,,,,,,,R&K,in-lab,MSLT,SOL (MSLT),,,,,,first 3 consecutive epochs of stage 1 or first epoch of any other sleep (R&K),,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,n/a,,,post-nap questionnaire,generic,,,,,,,,,1,,"1 night, 5 naps",1,matched,1,,,n/a,n/a,,,,,,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,0,,,,,,,,,,n/a,,,,,,n/a,mean values,,1,,,,,,,,1,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,n/a,"Wilcoxon signed rank, spearman correlations",n/a,,,,,

This discrepancy may be present in schizophrenia; however, limited data are available. We performed a secondary analysis to evaluate the agreement between 1-week actigraphy and sleep diary-derived parameters and factors that contribute to subjective-objective sleep discrepancy., PARTICIPANTS: 66 outpatients with schizophrenia (mean age = 44.08 years; 45.45% males)., METHODS: Agreement between subjective-objective parameters was assessed using two-way repeated measures ANOVA, Pearson's correlation, and Bland-Altman plot. The magnitude of discrepancy was quantified using Cohen's d. Pearson's correlation was used to determine the significant factors of subjective-objective sleep discrepancy. Benjamini-Hochberg adjustment was performed to account for multiple testing., RESULTS: On average, sleep diaries overestimated sleep onset latency by 20.45 min, total sleep time by 37.63 min, and sleep efficiency by 4.29%, but underestimated wake after sleep onset by 33.28 min. Cohen's d ranged between 0.61 and 1.41. Subjective-objective discrepancies were significantly associated with marital and employment status, self-reported sleep disturbance, delayed sleep-wake phase disorder, chronotype, and psychosocial functioning (r = 0.32-0.44; Benjamini-Hochberg corrected p < .05)., CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that differences between subjective and objective measurements of sleep are present in schizophrenia. Although actigraphy is not a standard procedure for sleep disturbance in schizophrenia, clinical judgment should be used if patients are suspected to have overestimated their sleep difficulties. Further studies should examine whether feedback based on actigraphy can benefit patients with schizophrenia and comorbid sleep disturbances.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,*Actigraphy/mt [Methods];Adult;Case-Control Studies;Female;Humans;Male;*Polysomnography/mt [Methods];*Schizophrenia/co [Complications];Self Report;*Sleep Wake Disorders/et [Etiology];Schizophrenia;Sleep,,,chung_discrepancy_2020,Subjective-Objective Sleep Discrepancy in Schizophrenia,"Chung et al., 2020",Korea,,,1,1,,,,,,outpatients with schizophrenia,schizophrenia,adults,,,schizophrenia,,,n/a,n/a,66,Actigraphy,,,1,1,,,,Actiwatch 2,,,Actiware Medium (40),,,,,Philips Actiware 6.0,Actiware,event marker or sleep diary,1,1,,,,,,,n/a,n/a,,"TST, SOL, WASO, SE",,,,standard,,actigraphy-defined,,,,TST/TIB*100,,,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,n/a,,,consensus sleep diary,Consensus Sleep Diary,1,,,,,,,,,,7 nights,7,matched,1,,,TST/TIB * 100,TIB-SOL-WASO-TWAK,TIB-SOL-WASO-TWAK,,,1,,LO-RT,direct question,direct question,direct question,"oTST-sTST, oSOL-sSOL, oWASO-sWASO, oSE-sSE",1,dTST_R,dSOL_R,dWASO_R,dSE_R,,,,,,0,1,,,,,algebraic difference score,"Repeated measures ANOVA, mean values",,1,,,,1,,,,1,1,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,n/a,"Bland altman, pearson correlation, two-way repeated measures (night, method) ANOVA",n/a,,,,,

DESIGN: For 12 days, participants wore actigraphs and completed sleep diaries. SETTING: Community. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred individuals who napped, aged 60 to 89 (including good and poor sleepers with typical age-related medical comorbidities). MEASUREMENTS: Twelve days of sleep diary and actigraphy provided subjective and objective napping and sleep data. RESULTS: Evening naps (within 2 hours of bedtime) were characteristic of the sample, with peak nap time occurring between 20:30 and 21:00 (average nap time occurred between 14:30 and 15:00). Two categories of nappers were identified: those who took daytime and evening naps and daytime-only. No participants napped during the evening only. Day-and-evening nappers significantly underreported evening napping and demonstrated lower objectively measured sleep onset latencies (20.0 vs 26.5 minutes), less wake after sleep onset (51.4 vs 72.8 minutes), and higher sleep efficiencies (76.8 vs 82%) than daytime-only nappers. CONCLUSION: Day and evening napping was prevalent in this sample of community-dwelling good and poor sleepers but was not associated with impaired nocturnal sleep. Although the elimination or restriction of napping is a common element of cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia, these results suggest that a uniform recommendation to restrict or eliminate napping (particularly evening napping) may not meet the needs of all older individuals with insomnia.","research; tables/charts.

However, in the near future, new technologies may provide us objective outcome measures as an alternative to self-report. The goal of this study is to compare subjective and objective sleep assessments in a population of failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS) patients, treated with spinal cord stimulation (SCS). Method(s): Twenty-two patients diagnosed with FBSS received SCS. Sleep data was collected at three time point: prior to SCS implantation (B), one month after SCS (T1), and two months after SCS (T2). Sleep data measured by actigraphy provided objective sleep data and were compared to Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) scores. Agreement between sleep parameters, total sleep time (TST), sleep efficiency (SE), and sleep onset latency (SOL), was examined. Result(s): Nineteen out of 22 patients completed the study. We identified significant differences between objective and subjective measurements for TST and SE at baseline and after two months of SCS, with patients underestimating both parameters on the PSQI in comparison to objective measurements. For SOL no significant differences were found, although patients subjectively overestimated SOL at B. Conclusion(s): The results about sleep measurements shown in this population of chronic pain patients, suggest that the subjective ratings scored worse than the objective measurements. Second, short-term SCS mainly seems to affect subjectively measured sleep parameters, especially SOL. This study shows the discrepancies between objective and subjective assessments in chronic pain research. Objective tools are indispensable for a correct assessment and treatment of sleep parameters. They are also playing a role as a biofeedback tool and are supporting the rehabilitation process.Copyright Â© 2018 International Neuromodulation Society","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,actimetry;adult;article;clinical article;clinical effectiveness;comparative study;*failed back surgery syndrome/di [Diagnosis];*failed back surgery syndrome/th [Therapy];female;human;latent period;male;neurofeedback;Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index;sleep parameters;*sleep quality;sleep time;*spinal cord stimulation;Spinal Cord,,,de_jaeger_does_2019,Does Spinal Cord Stimulation Really Influence Sleep?,"De Jaeger et al., 2019",Belgium,,,1,,,1,,,,failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS) patients treated with spinal cord stimulation,failed back surgery syndrome,adults,,,failed back surgery syndrome,,,n/a,n/a,19,Actigraphy,,,1,1,,,,Actiwatch Spectrum Plus,,,Actiware (not reported),,,,,Actiware 6.0.9,Actiware,not reported,,,,,,,1,,n/a,n/a,,"TST, SOL, SE",,,,standard,,actigraphy-defined,,,,TST/TIB*100,,,1,1,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,n/a,,,PSQI,Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI),,,,,1,,,,,,"14 nights, 3 instances (baseline, treatment 1, treatment 2)",42,matched,1,,,TST/TIB * 100,direct question,question,,1,,,LO-RT,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,0,,,,,,,,,,n/a,,,,,,n/a,mean values,,1,,,,,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,n/a,"bland altman plots, paired sample t test (for each timepoint)",n/a,,,,,

Objective sleep-wake measures for insomnia over-time described increasing sleep latency and decreasing sleep duration. The interview narratives provided context and insight into participants' subjective insomnia experiences. While participants' insomnia symptoms were present, they were resigned to endure insomnia, and the subjective measures reflected a more positive perception of sleep outcomes.Conclusion: A mixed methods approach provides a deeper understanding of sleep-wake disturbances and the differing quantitative objective and subjective results of sleep measures in the context of the participants' experience of the trajectory of insomnia symptoms before, during, and after lung cancer treatment.","Continental Europe; Double Blind Peer Reviewed; Editorial Board Reviewed; Europe; Expert Peer Reviewed; Peer Reviewed.

The current investigation was conducted to examine the distribution of sleep time misperceptions among a large (n = 173), diverse group of insomniacs and to determine if such misperceptions might relate to the patients' clinical characteristics. Consistent with previous studies, our subjects, as a group, produced sleep estimates that were significantly (p < 0.0001) lower than polysomnographically determined sleep times. However, patients' sleep time perceptions were widely distributed across a broad continuum, which ranged between gross underestimates and remarkable overestimates of actual sleep times. Results also showed that subgroups, formed on the basis of presenting complaints and diagnostic criteria (i.e. International Classification of Sleep Disorders nosology), differed in regard to the magnitude and direction of their sleep distortions. Moreover, these differences appeared consistent with the types of objective steep disturbances these subgroups commonly experience.

To date there are a limited number of studies that compare subjective and objective measures of sleep in populations of subjects with mood disorders. This study evaluated the relationship between subjective and objective measurements of total sleep time (TST) in a bipolar type I disorder (BD I) population.Methods: Thirty-nine subjects diagnosed with BD I participated in the study. Mood symptoms were assessed via YMRS and IDS-30-C. Subjects wore an actigraph device and maintained a sleep diary for seven consecutive days. Differences between TST as estimated via sleep diaries and actigraphy were calculated.Results: Objective and subjective measures of TST were significantly correlated (r=0.5151, p=0.0008). Secondary analysis revealed that the severity of depressive symptoms did correlate to this discrepancy (t=2.65, p=0.01).Limitations: The impact that medications have on the accuracy of TST reported was not investigated. Also, sleep diaries may have acted to prompt subjects to pay closer attention to their sleep habits and therefore more accurately report TST than in the average clinical setting.Conclusion: The results of the current study demonstrate a significant correlation between the estimation of TST as measured objectively via actigraphy and subjectively via sleep diaries in BD patients. Mood symptomotology might impact the accuracy of TST reported. Further study is warranted.","research.

However, to quantify this unique pain experience, objective parameters are not yet available in daily clinical practice. With regard to patients with failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS) treated with spinal cord stimulation (SCS), pain therapists may recover the individual functional information about the patient's posture from the implantable pulse generator (IPG) of the stimulator. The aim of this study is to investigate whether subjective self-reporting is in correlation with the functional capacities of a patient., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-nine patients with FBSS, treated with SCS were included. The accelerometer in the IPG detects positional changes and provides an objective output of seven functional positions (lying back, lying prone, lying left, lying right, transition, upright, and upright + mobile). The Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), VAS-diary, and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) were assessed to evaluate physical functioning, pain intensities, and subjective sleep quality. Additionally, 21 patients wore a wearable actigraph device to objectify sleep quality. The agreement and Spearman correlations between objective and subjective parameters were assessed., RESULTS: Spearman rank correlations revealed no significant correlations between the ODI (subscales walking, sitting, standing, and sleeping) and the output of the IPG (percentage upright + mobile, transition, upright, and lying, respectively). Sleep parameters measured with the Actiwatch and the PSQI were not in agreement., CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that self-reporting questionnaires do not correlate with the findings of objective measurements. Therefore, we recommend using both subjective and objective parameters when determining treatment options for FBSS patients.

Method(s): The effects of total sleep deprivation (TD) and selective rapid eye movement (REM) sleep deprivation (RD) on sleep perception were analyzed in normal volunteers. Thirty-one healthy males with normal sleep were randomized to one of three conditions: (i) normal uninterrupted sleep; (ii) four nights of RD; or (iii) two nights of TD. Morning perception of total sleep time was evaluated for each condition. Sleep perception was estimated using total sleep time (in hours) as perceived by the volunteer divided by the total sleep time (in hours) measured by polysomnography (PSG). The final value of this calculation was defined as the perception index (PI). Result(s): There were no significant differences among the three groups of volunteers in the total sleep time measured by PSG or in the perception of total sleep time at baseline condition. Volunteers submitted to RD exhibited lower sleep PI scores as compared with controls during the sleep deprivation period (P < 0.05). Both RD and TD groups showed PI similar to controls during the recovery period. Conclusion(s): Selective REM sleep deprivation reduced the ability of healthy young volunteers to perceive their total sleep time when compared with time measured by PSG. The data reinforce the influence of sleep deprivation on sleep perception.Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier B.V.,"RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,adult;article;body mass;controlled study;human;human experiment;male;night;normal human;*perception;perceptive discrimination;polysomnography;randomized controlled trial;REM sleep;*sleep deprivation;sleep pattern;sleep quality;sleep stage;sleep time;*sleep perception;Sleep Deprivation,,,goulart_sleepdeprivation_2014,Effects of different sleep deprivation protocols on sleep perception in healthy volunteers,"Goulart et al., 2014",Brazil,,,,1,,1,,,,healthy males with normal sleep randomised to three experimental groups,men; healthy adults,adults,,men,normative,,,"12 REM sleep deprivation group, 9 total sleep deprivation group, 10 control group",10 control group,31,PSG,1,1,,,,,,n/a,,,,,,,,n/a,n/a,n/a,,,,,,,,,AASM,in-lab,nocturnal,TST,,,,standard,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,n/a,,,morning questionnaire,generic,,,1,,,,,,,,7-9 depending on experimental group (some night entailed different experimental condition),7,matched,1,,,n/a,direct question,question,,1,,,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,sTST/oTST,1,rTST,,,,,,,,,0,,,1,,,ratio score,separate analysis per night,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,n/a,n/a,n/a,,,,,

This study assessed sleep in 60 prostate cancer patients taking androgen deprivation therapy with wrist actigraphy and daily diaries for 7 days. The Epworth Sleepiness Scale and the general version of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy scale were also administered. On average, total sleep time was 5.9 (SD = 1.4) h, and sleep efficiency was 75% (SD = 12.0) as assessed by actigraphy. There was generally poor concordance between actigraphy and daily diary for most sleep metrics. Subjects reported awakening, on average, 2.7 times per night, most commonly for nocturia and hot flashes. Assessment of daily functioning showed that participants had mild daytime sleepiness, which was predicted by total sleep time ( F(1,47) = 4.5, P= 0.04) General quality of life was not impaired.

Parameters indicating sleep fragmentation, such as number of awakenings, wake after sleep onset (WASO) and percentage of NREM1 were extracted from the polsysomnogram, as well as spectral power, microarousals and sleep spindle index. The correlation between these parameters during the first sleep cycle and the amount of misperceived sleep was assessed in the insomnia group. Additionally, we made a model of the minimum duration that a sleep fragment at sleep onset should have in order to be perceived as sleep, and we fitted this model to subjective SOLs of both subject groups.Results: Misperception of SOL was associated with increased percentage of NREM1 and more WASO during sleep cycle 1. For insomnia subjects, the best fit of modelled SOL with subjective SOL was found when assuming that sleep fragments shorter than 30Â min at sleep onset were perceived as wake. The model indicated that healthy subjects are less sensitive to sleep interruptions and perceive fragments of 10Â min or longer as sleep.Conclusions: Our findings suggest that sleep onset misperception is related to sleep fragmentation at the beginning of the night. Moreover, we show that people with insomnia needed a longer duration of continuous sleep for the perception as such compared to controls. Further expanding the model could provide more detailed information about the underlying mechanisms of sleep misperception.","research; tables/charts.

Objectives: The aim of this study is to explore potential mechanisms of sleep fragmentation influencing alterations of perceived sleep quality. Methods: We analyzed polysomnography (PSG) recordings from a double-blind crossover study with zopiclone 7.5 mg and placebo, in elderly participants with insomnia complaints and age-matched healthy controls. We compared survival dynamics of sleep and wake across group and treatment. Subsequently, we used a previously proposed model to estimate the amount of sleep onset latency (SOL) misperception from PSG-defined sleep fragmentation. Self-reported and model-estimated amount of SOL misperception were compared across group and treatment, as well as model prediction errors. Results: In the zopiclone night, the average segment length of NREM sleep was increased (group F = 1.16, p = 0.32; treatment F = 8.89, p< 0.01; group x treatment F = 0.44, p = 0.65), while the segment length of wake was decreased (group F = 1.48, p = 0.23; treatment F = 11.49, p< 0.01; group x treatment F = 0.36, p = 0.70). The self-reported and model-estimated amount of SOL misperception were lower during the zopiclone night (self-reported group F = 6.08, p< 0.01, treatment F = 10.8, p< 0.01, group x treatment F = 2.49, p = 0.09; model-estimated F = 1.70, p = 0.19, treatment F = 16.1, p< 0.001, group x treatment F = 0.60, p = 0.55). The prediction error was not altered (group F = 1.62, p = 0.20; treatment F = 0.20, p = 0.65; group x treatment F = 1.01, p = 0.37). Conclusions: Impaired subjective sleep quality is associated with decreased NREM stability, together with increased stability of wake. Furthermore, we conclude that zopiclone-induced changes in SOL misperception can be largely attributed to predictable changes of sleep architecture.","USA. | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,Intervention Studies;Wakefulness;Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders,,,hermans_assessing_2021,Assessing sleep-wake survival dynamics in relation to sleep quality in a placebo-controlled pharmacological intervention study with people with insomnia and healthy controls,"Hermans et al., 2021",Netherlands,,,,1,,,,,,older adults involved in a double-blind crossover study with zopiclone and placebo,older adults; insomnia,older adults,,,insomnia,,,"16 with insomnia complaints who frequently use hypnotics, 16 with insomnia complaints who did not or infrequently use hypnotics",16 age-matched self-defined good sleepers,46,PSG,1,1,,,,,,n/a,,,,,,,,n/a,n/a,n/a,,,,,,,,,R&K,in-lab,nocturnal,"TST, SOL",,,,standard,,first epoch of any sleep stage,,,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,n/a,,,morning questionnaire,generic,,,1,,,,,,,,1 night,1,matched,1,,,n/a,direct question,question,,1,,,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"sTST-oTST, sSOL-oSOL",1,dTST,dSOL,,,,,,,,0,1,,,,,algebraic difference score,single night,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,n/a,n/a,"Sleep Fragment Perception Index (SFPI), optimal parameter L (sleep length parameter) --> explained misperception (estimated SOL) difference between lights off and start of first sleep fragment longer than L (30 minutes).

We collected overnight sleep data via polysomnography (PSG), subjective sleep data via a morning questionnaire (self-evaluated) and MSLT data via four 20-min naps over 8h. Subjects included 122 PIPs and 48 GSCs. Sleep perception was calculated as subjective sleep time/objective sleep timex100%. PIPs showed a significant difference (P<0.001) between sleep time, as determined by PSG (387.8+/-100min) and self-report (226.3+/-160min), but no difference was obtained for GSCs (440.6+/-53 versus 435.4+/-65min). The means for sleep perception were 56.4+/-38.8% for the PIPs and 99.3+/-13.6% for the GSCs (P<0.001). In the PIPs group, weak but statistically significant negative correlations (r: -0.20 to -0.25) were found for MSLT versus sleep perception and versus self- and PSG-evaluated sleep time. Compared to PIPs with low scores on the MSLT, those with high scores had less sleep perception (%), less self- and PSG-evaluated sleep time and greater sleep misperception time. GSCs did not show significant correlations between MSLT and sleep measures or differences in comparisons between individuals with high and low scores on the MSLT.

Methods: 59 ADHC participants (95% male, mean age = 78 years) completed sleep questionnaires and 72 continuous hours of wrist actigraphy. Linear regression was used to examine agreement between methods and explore discrepancies in subjective/objective measures. Results: Disturbed sleep was common, yet there was no agreement between subjective and objective sleep assessment methods. Compared with objective measures, one-half of participants reported worse sleep efficiency (SE) on questionnaires while one-quarter over-estimated SE. Participants reporting worse pain had a greater discrepancy between subjective and objective SE. Conclusions: Vulnerable older adults demonstrated unique patterns of reporting sleep quality when comparing subjective and objective methods. Additional research is needed to better understand how vulnerable older adults evaluate sleep problems. Clinical Implications: Objective and subjective sleep measures may represent unique and equally important constructs in this population. Clinicians should consider utilizing both objective and subjective sleep measures to identify individuals who may benefit from behavioral sleep treatments, and future research is needed to develop and validate appropriate sleep assessments for vulnerable older adults.","research; tables/charts.

Self-report may be subject to recall bias based upon current mood/affect states. This study sought to identify the degree of inaccuracy between subjective and objective measures of sleep duration in those with and without BD, and to assess the demographic and clinical correlates of this inaccuracy.Methods: Thirty-one individuals with BD and 54 healthy control (HC) participants reported on the number of hours slept a night over the past month and subsequently completed up to 14 days/nights of wrist actigraphy which provided an objective measure of sleep duration. We compared the subjective rating to the average of all nights of objective sleep duration, and correlated the magnitude of inaccuracy with demographic and clinical characteristics in the BD and HC groups.Results: On average, both BD and HC groups overestimated their sleep, and there were no differences in inaccuracy between groups. In the BD group, greater inaccuracy was associated with lower functioning, even after controlling individually for objective and subjective sleep measures.Limitations: Cross-sectional study, only focus on sleep duration, and less severe bipolar symptoms of sample.Conclusions: Inaccuracy in reports of sleep duration was associated with lower functioning among BD patients. Better identifying discrepancies in reports of sleep duration in clinical practice could help in more efficient monitoring and management of BD symptoms.","research; tables/charts.

The objective of this study was to investigate the correlation between subjective and objective measures of sleep in persons with symptomatic bipolar disorder (BDS) compared to healthy controls (HC).Methods: We studied 24 BDS and 30 HC subjects similar in age, race and sex. Subjective sleep was measured with Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and objective sleep with 7-days of actigraphy. Absolute discrepancy variables were calculated by subtracting objective sleep latency (SL) and total sleep time (TST) on actigraphy from their respective subjective estimates from PSQI. Mood symptoms were measured with Young Mania Rating Scale and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale.Results: In the BDS group, subjective TST did not significantly correlate with objective TST, while it correlated in the HC group. The BDS group had significantly higher absolute discrepancy between subjective and objective SL and TST compared to the HC group. Multivariable regression analysis showed that severity of depression was associated with greater absolute discrepancy between subjective and objective TST within the BDS group.Limitations: Subjects are from a tertiary care center and were on medications for treatment of BD symptoms.Conclusion: There is low correlation between subjective and objective TST in BDS subjects and more severe depressive symptoms are associated with greater absolute discrepancy in TST. Objective rather than subjective measures of sleep, such as actigraphy, may be needed to evaluate sleep in BD subjects. Cognitive-behavioral interventions to address sleep misperception and associated depressed mood may be indicated in BD.","research.

R2H 2A6, Canada","There is little published literature on the correlation between subjective and objective efficacy of hypnotics. We wanted to determine whether there was a correlation between the patient's subjective evaluation of the efficacy of the hypnotic with the polysomnographic (PSG) findings. We studied 16 patients with chronic insomnia (sleep latency, >=30 minutes; total sleep time, >240 but <420 minutes) for 11 nights who took placebos on nights 1 and 2, zolpidem (imidazopyridine) on nights 3-9 and placebo on nights 10 and 11. Patients completed a questionnaire each morning following PSG, which evaluated subjective sleep quality, sleep latency and total sleep time. These data were compared to PSG findings to answer specific questions about sleep latency reduction, efficacy of the hypnotic after a week's use, sleep quality after discontinuing the drug, and any correlation between subjective and objective measures. PSG findings indicated a shortened sleep latency, increased total sleep time, decreased total wake time and increased sleep efficiency when patients ingested zolpidem 30 minutes before bedtime. We found that after 7 nights (nights 3-9) the drug was still effective in reducing sleep latency and increasing total sleep time. Upon withdrawal (nights 10 and 11) sleep returned to baseline (nights 1 and 2). Subjectively, the patients confirmed those findings on the questionnaire, as well as a subjective reduction in the number of awakenings and, interestingly, a subjective increase in the time spent awake after sleep. Many of the objective variables we examined correlated highly with the subjective variables. While on zolpidem, subjects believed and were objectively shown to have a decreased sleep latency, increased total sleep time and decreased time awake before persistent sleep, although they tended to overestimate sleep latency and time spent awake before persistent sleep and underestimated total sleep time. Although the correlation between objective and subjective measures was high for the group, in individual patients there was an impressive difference between the two, and the highest coefficient of variation between a subjective and objective measures was 0.453. No correlations were found with subjective measures of refreshing quality of sleep, decrease in number of awakenings, how sleepy patients felt in the morning or their ability to concentrate in the morning. Thus, we believe the PSG remains the keystone in the evaluation of hypnotic efficacy.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,adult;article;clinical article;controlled study;female;human;*insomnia/di [Diagnosis];*insomnia/dt [Drug Therapy];male;oral drug administration;*polysomnography;priority journal;*hypnotic agent;*zolpidem/dt [Drug Therapy];Hypnotics and Sedatives,,,kryger_subjective_1991,Subjective versus objective evaluation of hypnotic efficacy: Experience with zolpidem,"Kryger et al., 1991",Canada,,,1,,,1,,,,patients with chronic insomnia,insomnia,adults,,,insomnia,,,n/a,n/a,16,PSG,1,1,,,,,,n/a,,,,,,,,n/a,n/a,n/a,,,,,,,,,R&K,in-lab,nocturnal,"Objective: TST, various SOL parameters, other PSG; Subjective: TST, SOL, WASO, sleep quality, other sleep quality variables (non significant correlations not reported)",,,,standard,,first epoch of any sleep stage,first epoch Stage 2,first 20 consecutive epochs any stage of sleep (LPS),,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,various correlations,various correlations,,morning questionnaire,generic,,,1,,,,,,,,"11, however unclear which nights used for comparison analysis",11,matched,1,,,not reported,direct question,question,,1,,,n/a,not reported,not reported,not reported,n/a,0,,,,,,,,,,n/a,,,,,,n/a,not reported/ unclear,1,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,n/a,pearson correlations between methods,n/a,,,,,

DESIGN: Patients with PI were randomly assigned to CBT or a placebo intervention (PC). Ambulatory polysomnography was performed before and after treatment. SETTING: University medical center sleep laboratory. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty PI patients with sleep maintenance difficulty evident in subjective sleep measures. Interventions: CBT and PC. RESULTS: CBT led to a more rapid decline in EEG delta power over the night, compared with PC. This change was associated with subjective improvement in response to CBT. Furthermore, lower pretreatment peak EEG delta power in the first NREM cycle and a more gradual decline in delta power predicted a better response to CBT. Increased wake time during the day produced by CBT was correlated with an increase in the steepness of the slope of EEG delta power and subjective improvement. Traditional polysomnography measures were associated with the subjective CBT response to a greater degree among patients whose total sleep time estimates better approximated polysomnography-derived total sleep time. In contrast, changes in all-night averaged NREM EEG spectral indices were more strongly related to subjective improvement in individuals who underestimated total sleep time to a greater extent. CONCLUSIONS: CBT led to a more rapid decline in EEG delta power over the night. This change is linked to the therapeutic effect of CBT, which appears to occur in conjunction with an increase in homeostatic sleep drive. Traditional polysomnography indices and all-night averaged NREM EEG measures appear to be related to subjective improvements with CBT in subsets of patients with PI.","clinical trial; research.

Design(s): We compared EEG frequency spectra from REM and NREM sleep in PPI subjects subtyped as subjective insomnia sufferers (those with relatively long total sleep time and relative underestimation of sleep time compared with PSG), and objective insomnia sufferers (those with relatively short PSG total sleep time) with EEG frequency spectra in normals. We also studied the correlation between these indices and the degree of underestimation of sleep. Further, we determined the degree to which sleep EEG indexes related to sleep complaints. Setting(s): Duke University Medical Center Sleep Laboratory. Participant(s): Normal (N=20), subjective insomnia (N=12), and objective insomnia (N=18) subjects. Intervention(s): N/A Measurements and Results: Lower delta and greater alpha, sigma, and beta NREM EEG activity were found in the patients with subjective insomnia but not those with objective insomnia, compared with the normal subjects. These results were robust to changes in the subtyping criteria. No effects were found for REM spectral indexes. Less delta non- REM EEG activity predicted greater deviation between subjective and PSG estimates of sleep time across all subjects. For the subjective insomnia subjects, diminished low-frequency and elevated higher frequency non- REM EEG activity was associated with their sleep complaints. Conclusion(s): NREM EEG frequency spectral indexes appear to be physiologic correlates of sleep complaints in patients with subjective insomnia and may reflect heightened arousal during sleep.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,adult;aged;arousal;article;clinical article;controlled study;disease association;electroencephalogram;female;human;*insomnia/di [Diagnosis];male;nonREM sleep;polysomnography;priority journal;REM sleep;REM sleep deprivation;*sleep disorder/di [Diagnosis];sleep pattern;sleep time;Electroencephalography;Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders,,,krystal_spectral_2002,NREM sleep EEG frequency spectral correlates of sleep complaints in primary insomnia subtypes,"Krystal et al., 2002",USA,,,1,1,,,,,,"individuals with subjective insomnia, objective insomnia and normal controls",insomnia,adults,,,insomnia,,,"12 individuals with subjective insomnia, 18 individuals with objective insomnia",20 normal controls,50,PSG,1,1,,,,,,n/a,,,,,,,,n/a,n/a,n/a,,,,,,,,,R&K,home-based,nocturnal,"TST, WASO, SE",,,,standard,,,,,,TST/TIB*100,,,1,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,n/a,,,sleep diary,generic,1,,,,,,,,,,1 night,1,matched,1,,,not reported,not reported,not reported,,,,,n/a,not reported,not reported,not reported,"sTST-oTST, sWASO-oWASO, sSE-oSE, (sTST/oTST)*100",1,dTST,dWASO,dSE,rTST100,,,,,,0,1,,1,,,,single night,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,n/a,various PSG variables and spectral power variables used to predict various subjective sleep variables with multivariate regressions,n/a,,,,,

E-mail: lauderdale@uchicago.edu","BACKGROUND:: Recent epidemiologic studies have found that self-reported duration of sleep is associated with obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and mortality. The extent to which self reports of sleep duration are similar to objective measures and whether individual characteristics influence the degree of similarity are not known. METHOD(S):: Eligible participants at the Chicago site of the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study were invited to participate in a 2003g""2005 ancillary sleep study; 82% (n <= 669) agreed. Sleep measurements collected in 2 waves included 3 days each of wrist actigraphy, a sleep log, and questions about usual sleep duration. We estimate the average difference and correlation between subjectively and objectively measured sleep by using errors-in-variables regression models. RESULT(S):: Average measured sleep was 6 hours, whereas the average from subjective reports was 6.8 hours. Subjective reports increased on average by 34 minutes for each additional hour of measured sleep. Overall, the correlation between reported and measured sleep duration was 0.47. Our model suggests that persons sleeping 5 hours over-reported their sleep duration by 1.2 hours, and those sleeping 7 hours over-reported by 0.4 hours. The correlations and average differences between self-reports and measured sleep varied by health, sociodemographic, and sleep characteristics. CONCLUSION(S):: In a population-based sample of middle-aged adults, subjective reports of habitual sleep are moderately correlated with actigraph-measured sleep, but are biased by systematic over-reporting. The true associations between sleep duration and health may differ from previously reported associations between self-reported sleep and health.

Method(s): We analyzed data from 5764 individuals who underwent polysomnography (PSG) and replied questions about quantity and quality of sleep, including sleep depth. The difference between objectively recorded sleep time and subjectively estimated sleep time was calculated. Alpha-delta sleep (A-DS) was visually scored in a scale from 1 to 4, based on the density and overnight duration of alpha activity and confirmed using spectral array of the electroencephalographic activity. Result(s): A-DS scores 1-4 occurred in, respectively, 37.9%; 31.3%; 20.5%; and 6.2% of the cases. ANOVA showed significant difference of light sleep sensation (p < 0.001) and sleep time underestimation (p < 0.001) among the four A-DS categories. Regression to explain both light sleep and sleep time underestimation, controlling for confounders, confirmed A-DS as a significant regressor. Conclusion(s): This study of a large prospective sample provides evidence for the association of alpha-delta sleep with subjective sensation of light sleep and with sleep time underestimation. Significance: Alpha-delta sleep may be a marker of the physiological disorder underlying light sleep and sleep state misperception.

Whether a similar phenomenon occurs with other sleep disorders is not fully established. We compared the PSG sleep of 84 patients with suspected sleep apnea (SA) to their subjective experience of sleep reported on a sleep diary the morning after PSG testing. Both patients with SA (SA+) and those without (SA-) tended to overestimate SOL, but the SA+ group (n = 50) made larger overestimations (p < 0.02). The SA+ and SA- groups also differed in their accuracy at estimating TST, with SA+ patients underestimating TST (p < 0.05).

We have examined the possibility that the perception of having been awake or asleep may differ across the night. Eight subjects with sleep state misperception were awakened by a 500- Hz tone of progressive amplitude at five time points and were then asked to report whether they believed themselves to have been awake or asleep. This procedure was carried out on an early night during the first sleep cycle, and on a late night during the third sleep cycle, in random sequence. During the early Stage 2 trial, subjects were more likely to report having been awake, whereas in the late Stage 2 trial, they were more likely to report that they had been asleep. Conversely, in the REM sleep trial on the early night, subjects were more likely to report that they had been asleep. On the late night they were more likely to report that they had been awake, a change which was paralleled by a significant drop in scores on the Foulkes Dream Complexity Scale. Calculation of the duration of uninterrupted sleep prior to the trials suggests that this may have been a factor in the Stage 2, but not the REM, findings. There were no significant differences between the early and late REM trials in the frequency of dream reports, quality of dreams, or fragmentation of REM. These data indicate that subjects with sleep state misperception may experience REM sleep very differently in the first and third NREM-REM cycles.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,"adult;article;clinical article;clinical trial;controlled clinical trial;controlled study;female;human;male;night;perception;randomized controlled trial;rating scale;REM sleep;*sleep;*sleep disorder;sleep stage;Sleep Disorders, Intrinsic;Sleep Stages;Sleep",,,mendelson_perception_1998,Effects of time of night and sleep stage on perception of sleep in subjects with sleep state misperception,"Mendelson, 1998",USA,,,1,,,,1,,,participants who complained of poor sleep,poor sleep,adults,,,poor sleep,,,n/a,n/a,8,PSG (experimental awakenings),1,1,,,,,,n/a,,,,,,,,n/a,n/a,n/a,,,,,,,,,n/a,in-lab,,Participant report of having been awake/asleep following experimental awakenings,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,n/a,,,query following awakening,generic,,,,,,,1,,,,1 night,1,matched,1,,,n/a,n/a,,,,,,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,0,,,,,,,,,,n/a,,,,,,n/a,n/a,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,1,,,,n/a,"paired t-tests, chi-square tests for perception of wake/sleep following experimental awakening",experimental awakening procedure; chi-square for conditions (early/late) across stages of sleep,,,1,,

Design(s): Two night's home polysomnography were compared to sleep diaries. Five laboratory nights employed a series of recorded questions regarding perception of prior sleep-wake state, which were presented during sustained wake and interrupted Stage 2 and REM sleep. Setting(s): Sleep laboratory and participants' homes Participants: Fourteen insomniacs were compared to 8 good sleepers. Mean age for both groups was 58 years. Intervention(s): N/A. Measurements and Results: A signal detection theory analysis was applied to participants' responses to questions presented overnight in the laboratory concerning judgement of prior sleep-wake state and confidence in their decision. Insomniacs had reduced sleep-wake discriminability in addition to a greater bias toward reporting prior wakefulness in the laboratory compared to good sleepers. These measures correlated significantly with the degree of underestimation of total sleep and overestimation of wake recorded at home. Conclusion(s): Insomniacs' underestimation of total sleep time is the product of prior sleep being misperceived as wake time upon awakening overnight. This misperception may play a role in the perpetuation of insomnia.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,adult;aged;analytic method;article;clinical article;controlled study;female;home;human;*insomnia/di [Diagnosis];laboratory;male;perceptive discrimination;polysomnography;priority journal;*self concept;self report;signal detection;*sleep;sleep time;*wakefulness;Wakefulness,,,mercer_insomniacs_2002,Insomniacs' perception of wake instead of sleep,"Mercer et al., 2002",USA,,,1,1,,,1,,,individuals with insomnia and good sleepers,insomnia,adults,,,insomnia,,,14 individuals with insomnia,8 good sleepers,22,PSG,1,1,,,,,,n/a,,,,,,,,n/a,n/a,n/a,,,,,,,,,R&K,"in-lab, home-based",nocturnal,"home PSG: TST, SOL, WASO, SE; lab: signal detection for PSG-wake as signal (exp awakenings), TST, sleep between probes",,,,,,first 3 consecutive epochs of stage 1 or first epoch of any other sleep (R&K),,,,TST/TIB*100,,,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,"home PSG: TST, SOL, WASO; lab PSG: signal detection for PSG-wake as signal",,,home PSG: morning questionnaire; lab PSG: experimenter queries,generic,,,1,,,,1,,,,home: 2 nights; lab: 5 nights (once a week for five weeks),7,matched,1,,,TST/TIB * 100,not reported,not reported,,,,,not reported,not reported,not reported,not reported,"sTST-oTST, sSOL-oSOL, sWASO-oWASO",1,dTST,dSOL,dWASO,,,,,,,0,,,,,,algebraic difference scores,home recordings: mean values,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,n/a,interaction within an anova--group(insomnia vs normal) x method; ,Discrepancy as interaction within ANOVA; experimental awakening procedure--signal detection theory,1,,,,

Whether this perception can be expressed, in a standardized questionnaire as the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), has to our knowledge never been documented in CFS. Furthermore, correlations of subjective fatigue, PSQI, affective symptoms and objective parameters such as sleep efficiency are poorly described in the literature. Method(s): Using a cross-sectional paradigm, we studied subjective measures like PSQI, Fatigue Severity Scale scores and intensity of affective symptoms rated by the Hamilton Depression and Anxiety scales as well as objective sleep quality parameters measured by polysomnography of 28 'pure' (no primary sleep and no psychiatric disorders) CFS patients compared to age- and gender-matched healthy controls. Result(s): The PSQI showed significantly poorer subjective sleep quality in CFS patients than in healthy controls. In contrast, objective sleep quality parameters, like the Sleep Efficiency Index (SEI) or the amount of slow-wave sleep did not differ significantly. Subjective sleep quality showed a correlation trend with severity of fatigue and was not correlated with the intensity of affective symptoms in CFS. Conclusion(s): Our findings indicate that a sleep quality misperception exists in CFS or that potential nocturnal neurophysiological disturbances involved in the nonrecovering sensation in CFS are not expressed by sleep variables such as the SEI or sleep stage distributions and proportions.

Unfortunately, the data are often contradictory, and interpretations are often inconsistent. The current aims are to compare subjective and objective sleep data in pregnant women collected longitudinally in early pregnancy.Methods: In this secondary analysis of 104 pregnant women, sleep was collected via diary and actigraphy for 14 days during three separate occasions (10-12 weeks; 14-16 weeks; and 18-20 weeks). Sleep variables included wake after sleep onset (WASO), sleep efficiency (SE), bedtime/lights out, sleep onset latency (SL), and total sleep duration (TST). Repeated measures ANOVAs compared each sleep variable across Time and by Method of data collection, while controlling for parity and daytime naps.Results: Significant differences were noted for only the method of data collection for sleep component studied for WASO, F (1, 98)Â =Â 147.20, pÂ <Â 0.001; SE, F (1, 98)Â =Â 129.41, pÂ <Â 0.001); bedtime/lights out, F (1, 103)Â =Â 5.33, pÂ <Â 0.05); and sleep duration, F (1, 104)Â =Â 182.75, pÂ <Â 0.001).

These data highlight that these methodologies assess different constructs. We contend that these data may be useful as a reference to compare high-risk women or those with sleep disorders. Using a multi-modal approach to identify sleep disturbance in pregnancy is likely a more clinically useful option.","research. Journal Subset: Biomedical; Continental Europe; Europe.

Subjects (n=384, 67.9+/-7.7 yr) completed sleep and mood questionnaires, sleep log and actigraphic data. The major urinary melatonin metabolite (6-sulphatoxymelatonin, aMT6s) was assayed in fractional urine specimens for two 24-hr intervals. Although SRSL (26.5+/-24.4 min) and actigraphic sleep latency (ASL; 27.8+/-20.0 min) were correlated (r s=0.361, p<0.001), the short SRSLs tended to be underestimated whereas the long SRSLs tended to be overestimated as compared to ASL. SRSL was positively correlated with the scales of insomnia, mood and hot flash, hypertension, use of anti-hypertensive drugs and the acrophase and the offset of aMT6s. SRSL was negatively correlated with the global assessment of functioning scale in DSM-IV (GAF scale), and light exposure and wrist activity. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that the best-fit model to predict SRSL was light exposure, GAF scale, and use of anti-hypertensive drugs.

In this study, we evaluated 1) the extent to which high frequency EEG activity is limited to the 14-32 Hz domain, 2) whether high frequency EEG activity (HFA) is associated with discrepancies between subjective and PSG measures of sleep continuity, and 3) the extent to which high frequency EEG activity occurs in patients with primary, as opposed to secondary, insomnia. Design(s): Three groups (n=9 per group) were compared: Primary Insomnia, Insomnia secondary to Major Depression, and Good Sleeper Controls. Groups were matched for age, sex and body mass. Average spectral profiles were created for each NREM cycle after removing waking and movement epochs and epochs containing micro- or mini-arousals. Setting(s): Sleep Research Laboratory Patients or Participants: Patients with primary and secondary insomnia interventions: N/A Measurements and Results: Subjects with Primary Insomnia exhibited more average NREM activity for Beta-1 (14-20Hz), Beta-2 (20-35Hz) and Gamma activity (35-45Hz) than the other two groups (p.<.01). Group differences were also suggestive for Omega activity (45.0-125Hz) (p.<.10), with MDD subjects tending to exhibit more activity than the other groups. Correlational analyses revealed that average NREM Beta-1 and Beta-2 activity tended to be negatively correlated with subjective-objective discrepancy measures for total sleep time and sleep latency. Conclusion(s): Our results confirm that Beta activity is increased in Primary Insomnia. In addition, our data suggest that high frequency activity in patients with Primary Insomnia is limited to the Beta/Gamma range (14-45 Hz), and is negatively associated with the perception of sleep.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,adult;aged;article;beta rhythm;clinical article;depression/co [Complication];*electroencephalogram;female;human;human cell;human tissue;*insomnia/di [Diagnosis];male;nonREM sleep;polysomnography;priority journal;scoring system;Electroencephalography,,,perlis_eeg_2001,Beta/Gamma EEG activity in patients with primary and secondary insomnia and good sleeper controls,"Perlis et al., 2001",USA,,,,1,,,,,,"individuals with primary insomnia, insomnia secondary to depression, and good sleeper controls",insomnia; depression,adults,,,insomnia,depression,,"9 primary insomnia, 9 insomnia secondary to major depression",9 good sleeper controls,27,PSG,1,1,,,,,,n/a,,,,,,,,n/a,n/a,n/a,,,,,,,,,R&K,in-lab,nocturnal,"TST, SOL, WASO, number of awakenings",,,,standard,,first 3 consecutive epochs of stage 1 or first epoch of any other sleep (R&K),,,,,,standard,1,1,1,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,n/a,,,morning questionnaire,generic,,,1,,,,,,,,2 nights,2,matched,1,,,n/a,direct question,question,,1,,,n/a,direct question,direct question,direct question,"sTST-oTST, sSOL-oSOL, sWASO-oWASO, sAwakenings-oAwakenings",1,dTST,dSOL,dWASO,dAwak,,,,,,0,1,,,,,algebraic difference scores,not reported - confusing note in the methods section,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,n/a,n/a,n/a,,,,,

Subjects and methods: A total of 159 patients with insomnia, sleep-related movement disorders (SMD), hypersomnia, and parasomnia underwent full cardiorespiratory polysomnography with videometry during two consecutive nights. In addition, patients filled in sleep logs assessing subjective sleep parameters as well as several questionnaires including the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression scale (CES-D). Result(s): For the second night, not only subjective sleep efficiency, total sleep time (TST), and sleep latency but also objective TST and efficiency significantly differed across diagnostic groups. Comparison between subjective and objective TST, efficiency and latency revealed insomnia patients to significantly underestimate their sleep efficiency and TST, while overestimating their sleep latency. Subjective and objective sleep efficiency as well as sleep latencies differed significantly in the SMD group. Parasomnia and hypersomnia patients only showed significant differences in sleep latencies. PSQI scores significantly differed across patient groups. Conclusion(s): The PSQI is useful as a screening instrument for distinguishing between diagnostic categories of sleep disorders. Not only insomnia patients significantly misinterpreted sleep parameters, but patients with SMD, hypersomnia, and parasomnia also displayed significant misinterpretation of at least one sleep parameter.

Quantifying the misperception phenotype involves two operational challenges: defining objective sleep latency and treating sleep latency and total sleep time as independent factors. We evaluated a novel approach to address these challenges and test the hypothesis that sleep fragmentation underlies misperception. Method(s): We performed a retrospective analysis on patients with or without obstructive sleep apnea during overnight diagnostic polysomnography in our laboratory (n = 391; n = 252). We compared subjective and objective sleep-wake durations to characterize misperception. We introduce a new metric, sleep during subjective latency (SDSL), which captures latency misperception without defining objective sleep latency and allows correction for latency misperception when assessing total sleep time (TST) misperception. Result(s): The stage content of SDSL is related to latency misperception, but in the opposite manner as our hypothesis: those with > 20 minutes of SDSL had less N1%, more N3%, and lower transition frequency. After adjusting for misperceived sleep during subjective sleep latency, TST misperception was greater in those with longer bouts of REM and N2 stages (OSA patients) as well as N3 (non-OSA patients), which also did not support our hypothesis. Conclusion(s): Despite the advantages of SDSL as a phenotyping tool to overcome operational issues with quantifying misperception, our results argue against the hypothesis that light or fragmented sleep underlies misperception. Further investigation of sleep physiology utilizing alternative methods than that captured by conventional stages may yield additional mechanistic insights into misperception.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,adult;aged;article;controlled study;female;human;laboratory diagnosis;major clinical study;male;polysomnography;REM sleep;retrospective study;*sleep disordered breathing;*sleep parameters;*sleep time;sleep waking cycle;latency misperception;*sleep during subjective latency;*sleep fragmentation;Sleep Deprivation,,,saline_sleep_2016,Sleep fragmentation does not explain misperception of latency or total sleep time,"Saline et al., 2016",USA,,,,1,,,,,,adult patients referred to a clinical sleep laboratory,individuals referred for PSG,adults,,,referred for PSG,,,n/a,n/a,643,PSG,1,1,,,,,,n/a,,,,,,,,n/a,n/a,n/a,,,,,,,,,AASM,in-lab,nocturnal,sleep during subjective latency (SDSL); latency adjusted total sleep time (LA-TST),,,,,,first epoch of any sleep stage,,,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,n/a,,,morning questionnaire,generic,,,1,,,,,,,,1 night,1,matched,1,,,n/a,n/a,,,,,,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,sTST-oLA-TST --> binary categorical,1,atypical,,,,,,,,,binary,1,,,,,algebraic difference score to form categorical variable (binary),single night,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,n/a,n/a,Sleep During Subjective Latency (SDSL) amount of sleep in minute between first instance of any sleep stage and the subjective sleep onset,,,,,

To determine the impact of self-reported sleep problems on these measurements. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study using data from Wave 3 of The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (2014-2015). PARTICIPANTS: Community-dwelling older adults, aged >=50 years, with self-reported sleep information and >=4 days of actigraphy-based TST (n = 1520). MEASUREMENT: Self-reported total sleep time, daytime sleepiness, insomnia symptoms (trouble falling asleep, trouble waking too early) measured during a structured self-interview. Actigraphy-based total TST was collected using GENEactiv wrist-worn accelerometers. Demographic characteristics and health information were controlled for. Analyses included descriptive statistics, reliability and agreement analysis using paired t-tests, intra-class correlations and Bland-Altman analysis. Linear regression was used to model associations with measurement discrepancies. RESULT(S): Participants reported that they slept 7.0 hours (SD: 1.4, Range: 2.0-13.0 hours) on average, compared to 7.7 hours (SD: 1.2 hours, Range: 3.0-13.0 hours) recorded by accelerometry. Trouble falling asleep or waking too early ""most of the time"" were associated with under-reporting of sleep by 2.3, and 2.2 hours respectively. Agreement between measurements had an intra-class correlation of 0.18 and wide 95% limits of agreement (-3.90 to 2.55 hours). Under-reporting of sleep was independently associated with insomnia symptoms. CONCLUSION(S): The agreement between self-reported and actigraphy-based TST in community dwelling older adults was low. Self-reported insomnia symptoms were independently associated with under-reporting of sleep. Studies seeking to measure sleep duration should consider inclusion of questions measuring experience of insomnia symptoms to account for potential influence on measurements.Copyright Â© 2020 The Authors.

DESIGN: Validation sub-study nested within the Colombo Twin and Singleton Study (2012-2015). SETTING: Colombo, Sri Lanka. PARTICIPANTS: 175 adults with actigraphy, randomly selected from 3497 participants with self-reported sleep assessed in a population-based cohort. MEASUREMENTS: Self-reported sleep duration, ascertained by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), was compared to a minimum of four days of actigraphy. Bias and agreement were assessed using the Bland-Altman method and a novel application of criterion cut-point analysis. Objective measurements of wake after sleep onset (WASO) and sleep efficiency were evaluated. RESULT(S): Sri Lankans have short sleep duration; averaging 6.4h (SD 1.5) self-reported and 6.0h (SD 0.9) actigraphically. Poor sleep quality was prevalent with an average WASO of 49 min., and sleep efficiency <85%. Bias was observed, with self-report consistently over-reporting sleep on average by 27.6 min (95% CI: -0.68, -0.24) compared to objective measures, but wide individual variation in disagreement, ranging from over-reporting by 3.34h to under-reporting by 2.42h. A criterion cut-point method also failed to define agreed definitions of short and long sleep duration. CONCLUSION(S): Sleep in Sri Lankan adults, whether measured subjectively or objectively, is of short duration and suboptimal objective quality by High Income Country consensus standards. Given the high cardiometabolic morbidity in Sri Lanka and poor measurement agreement observed, this warrants further investigation and supports the need for culturally appropriate, reliable, and valid assessment for analytic epidemiology in non-Western settings.Copyright Â© 2018 National Sleep Foundation.

Over a 1-week period, sleep data were collected using sleep actigraphy and self-report. Across the entire sample, subjective and objective assessment methods of sleep were strongly correlated, although there were some notable within-group differences. Specifically, although sleep duration between groups did not differ based on actigraphy, veterans without PTSD reported sleeping 1 h and 11 min (p = .002) longer than did veterans with PTSD. In an effort to determine why individuals without PTSD might be overreporting sleep, we found that symptoms of emotional arousal (anger, anxiety, and nightmares) were significantly correlated with self-reported sleep duration, suggesting a pattern of higher autonomic arousal found in veterans with PTSD. Thus, although sleeping for 6 h, the higher levels of emotional arousal reported by veterans with PTSD may mean that they do not perceive their sleep as restful. Further research is necessary to determine if the sleep architecture of veterans with PTSD is actually different from that of combat veterans without PTSD and if such differences are actually amenable to standard behavioral treatments for this disorder.

In this population, the results obtained using a sleep diary tended to estimate a statistically significant earlier sleep onset time and longer total sleep time than those via actigraphy. For total sleep time, this tendency was more prominent in patients with a higher Epworth Sleepiness Scale score. In 5 of the 24 (20.8%) patients, the sleep diary records indicated >6h of total sleep time while the actigraphy records indicated <6h of total sleep time, with a discrepancy of >1h. These results suggested that sleep insufficiency in hypersomnia patients may be overlooked when their sleep time is assessed using only a sleep diary in the initial phase of the diagnostic procedure, and the simultaneous use of actigraphy may be preferable in this assessment.

In this study, sleep diaries were compared with actigraphy monitoring to investigate the correspondence between measures of sleep in children and adolescents and provide normative data. Differences in age, gender, and school day/weekend were investigated. Sixty-six (21 boys, 45 girls) children and adolescents (11-17 years) wore a wrist actigraphy monitor and completed a 7-day sleep diary. Measures of sleep onset, wake time, wake after sleep onset, and total sleep time were obtained. Less than recommended (9-11-h) amounts of sleep were obtained throughout the week and all participants underestimated the duration of their night wake. Children went to sleep significantly earlier and obtained more sleep than adolescents. Sleep onset and wake time were significantly later on weekends than school days for both age groups. No significant gender differences were found for any objectively measured sleep parameter. Correlations between diary and actigraphy were moderate to high and significant for sleep onset, wake time, and total sleep time. Paired samples t-tests indicated a significant difference between diary and actigraphy scores for all variables except children's sleep onset. Overall, children and adolescents overestimated their total sleep time by approximately an hour, primarily through an under appreciation of night awakenings. Â© 2010 The Authors.

Method(s): We retrospectively analyzed PSGs conducted between 2012 and 2016. Linear regression was applied to predict the discrepancy between selfreported and objective sleep parameters (total sleep time, sleep efficiency, sleep latency, using age, sex, arousal index, type of sleep disorder, and PSG type [laboratory vs ambulatory] as regressors). Result(s): A total of 303 PSGs were analyzed (49% women, median age 48 years), comprising patients with insomnia (32%), sleep-related breathing disorders (27%), sleep-related movement disorders (15%), hypersomnia/narcolepsy (14%), and parasomnias (12%). Sleep disorder was the best predictor of discrepancy between self-reported and objective total sleep time, and patients with insomnia showed higher discrepancy values compared to all other patient groups (P <.001), independent of age and PSG type (P > .05). Contributory effects for higher discrepancy values were found for lower arousal index. Patients with insomnia underestimated both total sleep time (median discrepancy: 46 minutes, P <.001) and sleep efficiency (median discrepancy: 11%, P <.001). No significant predictor for discrepancy of sleep latency was found. Conclusion(s): Misperception of sleep duration and efficiency is common in sleep lab patients, but most prominent in insomnia, independent of age, sex, or laboratory vs ambulatory recording setting.

We computed subjective-objective mismatch by the formula (subjective - objective value)/objective valueÂ Ã—100; negative and positive values indicated under- and overestimation, respectively.Results: In the entire sample, the magnitude of under- and overestimation of total sleep time was similar, but varied significantly between diagnostic groups, with insomnia and insufficient sleep syndrome showing the most pronounced underestimation and REM parasomnia and circadian rhythm disorders showing the most pronounced overestimation of total sleep time. In all diagnostic categories, a majority tended to overestimate their sleep onset latency and to underestimate the amount of WASO. Younger age was independently correlated with underestimation of total sleep time and WASO, and with overestimation of sleep onset latency. Overestimation of sleep onset latency independently correlated to an increased latency to N3 sleep stage on polysomnography.Conclusions: While sleep-wake misperception is highly prevalent in all sleep-wake disorders, significant differences exist in magnitude of under- and overestimation between distinct diagnostic groups.","research.

Design(s): Cross-sectional. Setting(s): University based sleep disorders center. Patient(s): Sleep disorder groups consisted of patients with psychophysiological insomnia (n=19), sleep state misperception (n=8), insomnia with depressive disorder (n=11), insomnia secondary to Axis I psychiatric disorder other than depression (n=21), periodic limb movement disorder (n=24), and obstructive sleep apnea (n=21). Measurement and Results: Patients completed a sleep history questionnaire and the MMPI, underwent overnight diagnostic polysomnographic assessment, and then estimated their total sleep time and sleep latency the subsequent morning. On average, patients overestimated sleep latency, but were equally likely to underestimate vs. overestimate total sleep time. Sleep time misperception was associated with longer periods of wakefulness following sleep onset, greater self-perceived sleep impairment, as well as several psychological dimensions. Conclusion(s): Patient factors, including sleep quality, perceptions of habitual sleep time, and current psychopathology, potentially influence sleep time estimation. Whereas psychological factors may lead to exaggeration of sleep disturbance among some patients, sleep quality itself may also influence the congruence between subjective and objective indices of sleep.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,adult;article;female;human;*insomnia/di [Diagnosis];latent period;major clinical study;male;polysomnography;priority journal;psychological aspect;*sleep disorder/di [Diagnosis];sleep pattern;Sleep Disorders;Sleep,,,vanable_sleep_2000,"Sleep latency and duration estimates among sleep disorder patients: Variability as a function of sleep disorder diagnosis, sleep history, and psychological characteristics","Vanable et al., 2000",USA,,,1,1,,,,,,patients referred to sleep clinic with various sleep disorders,sleep disorders; insomnia,adults,,,insomnia,sleep disorders,,"19 psychophysiological insomnia, 8 sleep state misperception, 11 insomnia with depressive disorder, 21 insomnia secondary to Axis I psychiatric disorder other than depression, 24 periodic limb movement disorder, 21 obstructive sleep apnoea",n/a,104,PSG,1,1,,,,,,n/a,,,,,,,,n/a,n/a,n/a,,,,,,,,,R&K and Mendelson,in-lab,nocturnal,"TST, SOL",,,,standard,,first 3 consecutive epochs of stage 1 or first epoch of any other sleep (R&K),,,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,n/a,,,morning questionnaire,generic,,,1,,,,,,,,1 night,1,matched,1,,,n/a,direct question,question,,1,,,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"sTST/oTST*100, sSOL/oSOL*100; sTST/oTST*100 --> trichotomy categorical, sSOL/oSOL*100 --> trichotomy categorical",1,rTST100,rSOL100,,,,,,,,trichotomy,,,1,,,"ratio score, ratio score to form groups (trichotomy)",single night,,,1,,,,,,,1,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,n/a,"pearson correlations, paired samples t-test",n/a,,,,,

Forty subjects with insomnia associated with chronic musculoskeletal pain completed questionnaires addressing clinical issues of pain severity, medication use, sleep quality, and affective distress. For 2 consecutive nights, each subject then completed a sleep diary and wore an actigraph unit on the non-dominant wrist. The results showed that the sleep diaries and the actigraphs provided similar estimates of total sleep time, time awake after sleep onset, and sleep efficiency, but differed in the measurement of sleep onset latency and nocturnal awakenings. Both methods of assessment exhibited low to moderate reliability across nights. Measures of the same sleep parameters across the two methods of assessment showed low concordance. Of the clinical variables, pain severity had the strongest association with disturbed sleep, but only using the diary method of assessment. Subjects who reported high pain severity also reported greater sleep impairment than subjects with low pain severity, but this was not confirmed by actigraphy. In general, both methods of assessment point to the significance of insomnia associated with chronic musculoskeletal pain as a distinct clinical problem, but the activity monitoring and self-report procedures provide different information. These findings suggest that multi-method assessment is an important consideration for studies of insomnia in patients with chronic pain.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,actimetry;adult;ambulatory monitoring;article;clinical article;controlled study;disease association;disease severity;female;human;*insomnia;male;*myalgia;priority journal;*sleep;Polysomnography;Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders,,,wilson_daily_1998,Daily diary and ambulatory activity monitoring of sleep in patients with insomnia associated with chronic musculoskeletal pain,"Wilson et al., 1998",Canada,,,1,,,,,,,individuals experiencing insomnia associated with chronic musculoskeletal pain,chronic musculoskeletal pain,adults,,,chronic musculoskeletal pain,,,n/a,n/a,40,Actigraphy,,,1,1,,,,Mini Motionlogger,,,Cole-Kripke,Webster's rescoring rules,,,,not reported,not reported,not reported,,,,,,,1,,n/a,n/a,,"TST, SOL, WASO, awakenings",,,,standard,,actigraphy-defined,,,,,,standard,1,1,1,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,n/a,,,sleep diary,generic,1,,,,,,,,,,2 nights,2,matched,1,,,not reported,direct question,question,,1,,,n/a,not reported,not reported,not reported,n/a,0,,,,,,,,,,n/a,,,,,,n/a,"separate analysis per night, mean values",,1,,1,,,,,,1,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,n/a,"pearson correlations, paired sample t-tests",n/a,,,,,

DESIGN AND SETTING: High school students completed a Sleep Habits Survey about the previous 2 weeks and then wore an actigraph (AMI, Ardsley, NY) for 8 days while keeping a daily sleep diary. Matched-pair t tests assessed average differences between survey and diary reports and between survey and actigraph estimates. Pearson correlations assessed the extent to which survey reports were in agreement with diary reports and actigraphy estimates. PARTICIPANTS: 302 high school students (196 girls, 106 boys) in grades 9-12 from five high schools. RESULT(S): School-night survey total sleep times and wake times did not differ from sleep amounts reported in the diary or estimated by actigraphy; survey bedtimes were slightly earlier. On weekends, survey total sleep times and wake times were longer and later, respectively, than estimated with actigraphy and reported on diaries. Moreover, school- and weekend-night survey variables were significantly correlated both with diary and actigraphy variables. Strengths of the associations were consistently greater for school-night variables than the corresponding weekend-night variables.

However, there is no valid and reliable self-report sleep questionnaire for elementary school-aged children. The aim of this study was to examine the availability of a simple self-report sleep questionnaire for 9- to 12-year-old children. Participants were 58 children aged 9-12 years from one elementary school in a rural area of Japan. Participants wore an accelerometer for 10 consecutive days and completed the sleep questionnaire twice. Sleep measures included bedtime, wake time, and assumed and actual sleep duration on weekdays and weekends. The data obtained from the accelerometer and sleep/wake scoring software were used to assess criterion validity. Pearson correlation coefficients and Bland-Altman plots were used to evaluate the relationships between objective and self-reported sleep measures. Test-retest reliability was evaluated using intraclass correlation coefficients. The correlations between the objective and questionnaire measures were moderate to high (r = 0.45 to 0.90) and significant, except girls' wake time, assumed sleep duration, and actual sleep duration on weekends. The Bland-Altman plots indicated that bedtime and wake time obtained from the questionnaire were underestimated for both weekdays and weekends. Test-retest reliability of the questionnaire was high, with intraclass coefficients ranging from 0.71 to 0.99. Although caution should be exercised when evaluating sleep duration on weekends, this simple self-reported sleep questionnaire is a useful tool for assessing sleep habits in 9- to 12-year-old children, particularly in school-based and large-scale epidemiological studies.Copyright Â© 2014 The Authors.

Results: The effect size of placebo acupuncture was estimated at 0.18 for total sleep time, 0.08 for sleep efficiency, and 0.92 for ISI score. Eighteen (20.9%) of the 86 participants were responders. Responders had a higher ISI score (p = 0.03), higher sleep diary-derived total sleep time (p = 0.02), less discrepancy between sleep diary-derived and actigraph-derived total sleep time (p = 0.03), and higher expectation toward acupuncture (p = 0.03) at baseline compared to nonresponders. Multivariate regression analysis found that only ISI score remained significant (odds ratio = 1.23, 95% confidence interval = 1.02-1.50, p = 0.03). Conclusions: Baseline sleep parameters and perceived effectiveness were shown to predict the placebo response of acupuncture for insomnia. Although the study was limited by a small sample size, our findings highlighted the potential implication of sleep duration and sleep-state misperception in the treatment of insomnia.

Many studies have shown that hyperarousal plays a key role in the pathophysiology of insomnia disorder. However, the specific brain mechanisms underlying insomnia disorder remain unclear. To elucidate the neuropathophysiology of insomnia disorder, we investigated the brain functional networks of patients with insomnia disorder and healthy controls across the sleep-wake cycle. EEG-fMRI data from 33 patients with insomnia disorder and 31 well-matched healthy controls during wakefulness and nonrapid eye movement sleep, including N1, N2 and N3 stages, were analyzed. A medial and anterior thalamic region was selected as the seed considering its role in sleep-wake regulation. The functional connectivity between the thalamic seed and voxels across the brain was calculated. ANOVA with factors ""group"" and ""stage"" was performed on thalamus-based functional connectivity. Correlations between the misperception index and altered functional connectivity were explored. A group-by-stage interaction was observed at widespread cortical regions. Regarding the main effect of group, patients with insomnia disorder demonstrated decreased thalamic connectivity with the left amygdala, parahippocampal gyrus, putamen, pallidum and hippocampus across wakefulness and all three nonrapid eye movement sleep stages. The thalamic connectivity in the subcortical cluster and the right temporal cluster in N1 was significantly correlated with the misperception index. This study demonstrated the brain functional basis in insomnia disorder and illustrated its relationship with sleep misperception, shedding new light on the brain mechanisms of insomnia disorder and indicating potential therapeutic targets for its treatment.

Actigraphy involves acquisition of data using a movement sensor worn continuously on the nondominant wrist, typically for a week or more. Although actigraphy provides objective and accurate sleep data, sleep diaries have been a practical alternative. However, there is a lack of research on the agreement and consistency between the two methods of measuring sleep for shift work nurses. In addition, differences in sleep patterns by shift types among 8-hour fast-rotating shift work nurses has not yet been examined. To evaluate the agreement between the sleep diary and actigraphy methods for sleep assessment, and to compare sleep parameters of 8-hour fast-rotating shift work nurses according to shift type. Descriptive and prospective study design. Two tertiary hospitals in Seoul, South Korea. A total of 94 shift work nurses who wore actigraphy along with completing a sleep diary. Subjective and objective sleep parameters were recorded during a two-week period in a sleep diary and actigraphy, respectively. Bland-Altman plots and intraclass correlation coefficients were used to analyze the agreement between the two methods. Sleep parameters according to shift type were compared using the Kruskalâ€“Wallis and Mannâ€“Whitney U tests. Good agreement was observed between the sleep diary and the actigraphy data for total sleep time (intraclass correlation coefficients = 0.765 or 0.858) and variability in sleep time (intraclass correlation coefficients = 0.838). When compared to the actigraphy data, diary-derived data were overestimated by 41â€“45 min for total sleep time and 0.4% for variability in sleep time. There was a difference of 2â€“3 h of sleep quantity by shift type: 5.3â€“5.8 h for day shifts and 7.1â€“8.4 h for night shifts. A sleep diary can function as an acceptable alternative to actigraphy for measuring shift work nurses' sleep patterns, specifically total sleep time and variability in sleep time. Given the high variability in sleep among shift work nurses, both personal and organizational efforts are required. Nurses should monitor their sleep quantity and develop their own regular sleep schedules to fit their work schedules. Hospitals should establish healthy schedules for nurses to guarantee sufficient sleep hours before work. Future research on shift work nurses' sleep should examine fluctuations in sleep duration.","research; tables/charts. Journal Subset: Core Nursing; Europe; Nursing; Peer Reviewed; UK & Ireland.

The present study examined whether a brief behavioral therapy for insomnia (BBTi) is efficacious for reducing sleep discrepancy in older adults. Methods: This study is a secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial of BBTi for community dwelling older adults with chronic insomnia (N = 62). Thirty-two participants received BBTi, delivered in four individual face-to-face sessions. Thirty received the self-monitoring control (SMC). They all completed daily sleep diaries and wore an actigraph from baseline to posttreatment, and for 2 weeks at 3-month follow-up. Sleep discrepancy was calculated by subtracting diary from actigraphy estimates of sleep onset latency (SOL), wake after sleep onset (WASO), and total sleep time (TST). Mixed modeling was used to analyze data. SOL discrepancy decreased significantly in BBTi participants compared to SMC participants. The decreases in SOL discrepancy were explained by changes in diary-assessed SOL and subjective sleep quality but not changes in actigraphy-assessed SOL. Although WASO discrepancy and TST discrepancy decreased from baseline to posttreatment and follow-up, the Time by Group interaction effects were not significant indicating that BBTi participants did not experience greater reductions in WASO discrepancy and TST discrepancy than SMC participants. In conclusion, BBTi is efficacious for reducing SOL discrepancy in older adults with chronic insomnia.","1540-2010     Chan, Wai Sze     Dautovich, Natalie D     McNamara, Joseph P H     Stripling, Ashley     Dzierzewski, Joseph M     McCoy, Karin     McCrae, Christina S     Orcid: 0000-0003-4313-6867     K23 AG049955/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States     L30 AG024875/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States     R21 AG024459/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States     T32 AG020499/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States     Journal Article     Randomized Controlled Trial     Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural     Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't     2020/02/11     Behav Sleep Med. 2021 Mar-Apr;19(2):221-231. doi: 10.1080/15402002.2020.1726750.

The main objective of the present study was to investigate the prevalence of poor quality of sleep in individuals with OA in Taiwan and identify potential predictors. A secondary objective was to examine agreement between objective and subjective measures of sleep quality. Methods In a cross-sectional survey, OA outpatients in Taiwan completed a self-administered questionnaire, incorporating validated measurements for assessing quality of sleep (the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)), pain and physical functioning, anxiety and depression, and health-related quality of life. In a nested feasibility study, a sub-sample of participants wore an Actigraph wrist monitor to measure sleep objectively over a three-day period. Results Of 192 individuals with OA who completed the survey, 30 completed the Actigraph study. The mean PSQI global score was 9.0 (standard deviation 4.5); most participants (135, 70.3%) had poor quality of sleep (global PSQI >5). Key predictors of poor quality of sleep included role limitation due to poor physical functioning, poor social functioning, higher anxiety levels and higher pain levels. There were moderate correlations between subjective and objective measures of sleep quality, although participants underestimated their true sleeping time by two hours. Conclusions Health professionals need to discuss sleep issues with individuals with OA and include strategies for coping with these difficulties. For reduced night-time pain which may interfere with sleep, additional and appropriate advice about medication is required. Copyright Â© 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","research; tables/charts.

Since it has an impairing effect on daytime well-being and neglects possible positive objective improvements, it would be useful if it was treated. Apart from hypnotics, cognitive behavior therapy (CBT-I) is the therapy of choice for chronic forms of insomnia. However, there is limited information about whether CBT-I can also improve subjective-objective sleep discrepancy. We investigated a large sample of patients showing chronic forms of insomnia regarding their subjective-objective sleep discrepancy pre and post CBT-I. Objective sleep data were obtained from 3 nights (2 baseline nights and 1 night after therapy) using polysomnography in our sleep laboratory. All 92 patients participated in a 14-day inpatient program with CBT-I including psychoeducation about subjective-objective sleep discrepancy. Repeated measures analyses showed an improvement in subjective-objective sleep discrepancy parameters after CBT-I. Those parameters were also correlated with perceived quality of sleep. We conclude that CBT-I is a useful tool to improve subjective-objective sleep discrepancy in patients showing chronic forms of insomnia.","Europe; Peer Reviewed; UK & Ireland.

It was hypothesized that subjective insomniacs could be trained to accurately estimate sleep latency by learning to differentiate wakefulness from sleep. Ten subjective insomniacs were randomly assigned to one of two groups. Group 1 subjects participated in both a control and a training week; group 2 subjects participated only during a training week. Each week consisted of a baseline lab night, a training lab night (treatment or control), a home (unmonitored night) and a recovery lab night. During training, subjects were taught to use sleep markers (A, B or C) to help them more accurately estimate sleep latency and were given feedback about the accuracy of their estimates. Marker A corresponded to an electroencephalographic level of wakefulness; marker B corresponded to the initial sleep spindle; marker C corresponded to 5 minutes of continuous sleep after the first sleep spindle. In the control condition, subjects had no feedback and were not taught to use markers to help them judge sleep from wakefulness. Total sleep time and percent stage 3 sleep increased, and objective sleep latency decreased on recovery nights. After training, subjective sleep latency, correctness of estimates of sleep versus wakefulness and perceived ability to fall asleep significantly improved. This study helps to establish that subjective insomniacs can learn to more accurately estimate sleep from wakefulness with the use of sleep-wake markers.","Cited By :27     Export Date: 25 April 2022 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,Behavior;Insomnia;Sleep;Sleep disorders;Subjective insomnia,,,downey_training_1992,Training subjective insomniacs to accurately perceive sleep onset,"Downey & Bonnet, 1992",USA,,,1,1,,,1,,,subjective insomniacs,subjective insomnia,adults,,,subjective insomnia,,,5 receiving a week of sleep estimation training,5 receiving a control week and a week of sleep estimation training,10,PSG,1,1,,,,,,n/a,,,,,,,,n/a,n/a,n/a,,,,,,,,,not reported,in-lab,nocturnal,"SOL, participant sleep/wake judgement following experimental awakenings",,,,,,not reported,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,n/a,,,participant report,generic,,,,,,,1,,,,"1 + 1 + 1 + 1 (baseline lab, training or control, home unmonitored, recovery lab)",1,n/a,n/a,n/a,,n/a,n/a,,,,,,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,sSOL/oSOL,1,rSOL,,,,,,,,,0,,,1,,,ratio score,single night,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,n/a,sleep-wake estimation accuracy following experimental awakenings,sleep-wake estimation accuracy following experimental awakenings; groups compared on percentage correct with independent samples t-tests,,,1,,

Self-reported sleep differed from EEG-derived estimates: wake after sleep onset was greater by EEG than by diary (dâ€¯=â€¯2.58, 95 % CI 1.74-3.63), and total sleep time and sleep efficiency were lower by EEG than by diary (d for sleep timeâ€¯=â€¯2.93, 95 % CI 2.06-4.14; d for efficiencyâ€¯=â€¯1.69, 95 % CI 0.98-2.49).Conclusions: Patients treated with buprenorphine or methadone did not substantively differ in ambulatory measures of sleep. With both medications, there was a discrepancy between objective and subjective sleep measures. Further confirmatory evidence would inform the development of sleep-related recommendations for OUD patients undergoing agonist treatment.","Europe; Peer Reviewed; UK & Ireland.

Method(s): Participants comprised 385 students (59% male) from grades 9 to 11, aged between 13 and 18 years (M = 15.6, SD = 1.0), from eight co-educational high schools of varied socio-economic status in metropolitan Adelaide, South Australia. The cross-sectional study used a questionnaire battery including the Sleep Anticipatory Anxiety Questionnaire -Adolescent Version (SAAQ-A), completed during school time, followed by eight days of sleep diary completion and wearing wrist actigraphy to obtain subjective and objective sleep onset latency (SOL). Result(s): Significant relationships were found between somatic arousal (SAAQ-A subscale) and objective SOL and also between sleep-related cognitions (SAAQ-A subscale) and subjective SOL and SOL overestimation (sleep misperception). No relationships were found between subjective SOL and somatic or rehearsal and planning cognitions. Objective SOL was not related to rehearsal and planning and to sleep-related cognition scores, and sleep misperception had no relationship with somatic as well as rehearsal and planning cognition scores.

The goal of the current study is to determine whether changes in polysomnographic (PSG) sleep patterns accompany subjective sleep complaints in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). We further examine whether meaningful changes in objective sleep physiology are predicted by self-reported sleep measures in MCI patients, and whether incipient neurodegeneration contributes to exacerbate sleep misperception. DESIGN SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Overnight PSG recordings and self-reported sleep measures were obtained from 25 healthy elderly (HE) subjects and 25 patients with MCI at the sleep laboratory. RESULTS: Both PSG and self-reported sleep measures confirmed that sleep is altered in patients with MCI. Whereas subjective sleep responses predicted fragmentation of slow wave sleep (SWS) in HE individuals, this relationship was not evident in MCI patients. Furthermore, patients with MCI showed significant discrepancies in the estimation of sleep onset latency when compared with HE subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Sleep is significantly impaired in patients with mild cognitive impairment at both the objective and subjective level, which may be used as a surrogate marker of preclinical Alzheimer disease. Taken together, these findings aid in the development of novel therapeutic strategies devoted to improve sleep in the elderly population at risk of developing Alzheimer disease.

Kobayashi, Psychiatry, Howard University, Washington, DC, United States","Introduction: Reports of sleep disturbances are common among individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Polysomnographic (PSG) studies, however, have been inconsistent in documenting abnormalities leading some investigators to suggest ""sleep state misperception"" in PTSD. Our study objectives were to compare objectively and subjectively measured sleep parameters in the lab and at home in civilians with and without trauma exposure and PTSD. Method(s): 103 urban-residing African Americans with and without trauma exposure and PTSD who participated in a larger study completed lab PSG and home actigraphy. A sleep diary was completed in the morning after PSG and actigraphy recordings. Habitual sleep during the month prior to the participation was assessed using a sleep questionnaire. The Clinician Administered PTSD Scale was administered to assess participants' trauma exposure and PTSD status. We analyzed sleep parameters [total sleep time (TST), sleep onset latency (SOL), and wake after sleep onset (WASO)] using 2 (objective vs. subjective sleep measures) x 4 (Current PTSD vs. Lifetime PTSD vs. Trauma-positive without PTSD vs. Trauma-negative) mixed ANCOVAs with sleep measures as the repeated measure. Result(s): Participants, regardless of trauma/PTSD status, underestimated WASO in the diary and questionnaire relative to actigraphy (F = 81.3, p < .001; F = 13.4, p < .001, respectively) and overestimated SOL in the diary relative to PSG (F = 5.6, p < .05). Among participants with current PTSD, TST diary estimates did not differ from the actigraphy measure in contrast to those without current PTSD who overestimated TST (F = 3.3, p < .05). No other group differences in subjective-objective sleep discrepancies were found. Conclusion(s): Discrepancies between subjectively and objectively measured sleep parameters were not associated with trauma exposure or PTSD. This challenges prior assertions that individuals with PTSD overreport their sleep disturbances.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,"*sleep;*organization;*exposure;*injury;*posttraumatic stress disorder;human;actimetry;implantable cardioverter defibrillator;sleep parameters;sleep disorder;questionnaire;sleep time;lifespan;recording;latent period;African American;Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic",,,kobayashi_ptsd_2012,Subjectively and objectively measured sleep with and without posttraumatic stress disorder and trauma exposure,"Kobayashi et al., 2012",USA,,,1,,,,,,,urban-residing African Americans with and without trauma exposure and PTSD,post-traumatic stress disorder; trauma exposure,adults,,,post-traumatic stress disorder,,,"25 PTSD current, 24 PTSD lifetime, 31 trauma positive",23 trauma negative,103,"PSG, Actigraphy",1,1,1,1,,,,Mini Motionlogger,,,Sadeh,,,,,Ambulatory Monitoring Action W-2 software,Action W2,"sleep diary, habitual sleep questionnaire",,1,,,,,,,AASM,in-lab,nocturnal,"TST, SOL, WASO",,,,standard,,first epoch of any sleep stage,,,,,,,1,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,n/a,,,"sleep diary, habitual sleep questionnaire",generic,1,,,,,1,,,,,2 nights,2,matched,1,,,n/a,calculated from TIB-SOL-WASO,TIB-SOL-WASO,,,1,,n/a,number of awakenings multiplied by average length of awakenings,calculated,number of awakenings multiplied by average length of awakenings,n/a,0,,,,,,,,,,n/a,,,,,,n/a,not reported,1,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,n/a,"pearson correlations, mixed 2 x 4 ANOVAs (method as within subjects, group as between-subject)",n/a,,,,,

This study examined the use of actigraphy in the measurement of sleep of patients with depression and insomnia. Fifty-four patients diagnosed with a current major depressive episode and chronic insomnia underwent a baseline overnight study with concurrent actigraphic and polysomnography (PSG) monitoring, as well as subjective sleep diaries. Agreement between PSG, actigraphy and sleep diary measurements was evaluated using two-tailed t-tests, Pearson's correlations and the Bland-Altman concordance technique. The only significant difference found between actigraphy and PSG was in latency to persistent sleep, in which actigraphy underestimated sleep latency relative to PSG (P<0.05). There were moderate positive correlations between actigraphy and PSG for all variables. In contrast, significant differences were observed between sleep diaries and PSG for all sleep variables. Bland-Altman concordance diagrams also demonstrated that, while bias was limited between PSG and the other two measurement types, there were somewhat broad 95% limits of agreement for all sleep variables with both sleep diaries and actigraphy. In summary, actigraphic measurements of sleep more closely approximated those of PSG than did sleep diaries in this sample of depressed insomniacs.

However, workers may perceive their sleep to be worse than it actually is. The aim of this study was to compare participants' pre- and post-sleep estimates of sleep duration and sleep quality with objectively measured sleep when on-call under laboratory conditions. Participants 72 healthy, adult males. Methods Analyses were performed on three interrelated studies, all of which consisted of four nights in a sleep laboratory. Following adaptation and baseline nights were two on-call nights (sleep opportunity 23:00 h - 07:00 h). Before and after each sleep opportunity, participants provided subjective estimates of sleep. Sleep was objectively measured using polysomnography. Results Estimated sleep duration (6.74 +/- 1.13 h) and sleep onset latency (20.55 +/- 14.85 min) were significantly poorer than objectively measured sleep outcomes (sleep duration 7.21 +/- 1.25 h; sleep latency 13.20 +/- 10.06 min). Of the variance in post-sleep estimated sleep duration, 14% was associated with objectively measured minutes of N3 (R2DELTA = 0.55) and REM (R2DELTA = 0.75). Additionally, 14% of post-sleep sleep quality estimation variance was associated with minutes of N2 (R2DELTA = 0.60) and N3 (R2DELTA = 0.79), measured by polysomnography. Conclusions Some objective measures of sleep were associated with subjective estimates of sleep duration and sleep quality. However, individuals may overestimate sleep onset latency and underestimate sleep duration during on-call periods. It may be beneficial for on-call workers to actively reflect on feelings of fatigue/alertness for workplace fatigue management, rather than relying solely on estimates of sleep.

Intervention(s): Participants took part in a treatment protocol investigating different sequential treatments for insomnia (these results are reported elsewhere). Measurements and Results: Compared to polysomnography, both actigraphy and sleep-diary instruments underestimated total sleep time and sleep efficiency and overestimated total wake time. Also, actigraphy underestimated sleep-onset latency while the sleep diary overestimated it as compared to polysomnography. Actigraphy data were more accurate than sleep-diary data when compared to polysomnography. Finally, actigraphy was sensitive in detecting the effects of treatment on several sleep parameters.

However, their agreement in diabetes patients remains unclear. The objective of this study was to examine the agreement between sleep outcomes measured by actigraphy and sleep diaries in aging adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D).Methods: A convenience sample of 53 T2D adults (aged 50-76 years) were enrolled. Participants wore a wrist ActiGraph and filled out a daily sleep diary for eight days. Total sleep time (TST), sleep efficiency (SE), sleep onset latency (SOL), and wake after sleep onset (WASO) were obtained from the actigraphy and sleep diaries. Bland-Altman plots were conducted to examine the agreement between each sleep outcome.Results: The differences for TST and SE assessed by actigraphy and sleep diaries were 11.3Â min (SD 65.3) and 0.2% (SD 10.5). Bland-Altman plots revealed wide limits of agreement between actigraphy- and diary-measured TST (95%CI:Â -139.3Â min, 116.7Â min) and SE (95%CI:Â -20.9%, 20.4%). Systematic biases were present for WASO and SOL: compared to actigraphy, sleep diaries underestimated WASO and overestimated SOL. As the SOL and WASO increased, the agreement became lower.Conclusion: Overall, the agreement between actigraphy and sleep diaries is poor across all measures in aging adults with T2D patients. Findings from this study highlight the need for sleep researchers and clinicians to consider the method used for sleep assessment when developing interventions or interpreting study findings.","research.

However, research suggests that, among individuals with PTSD, self-reported sleep impairment is typically more severe than what is objectively observed, a phenomenon termed sleep state misperception. Relatively little research has examined which individuals with PTSD are most likely to exhibit sleep state misperception. This study explored clinical predictors of sleep state misperception in a sample of 43 women with PTSD and clinically significant sleep impairment. METHOD(S): During a baseline assessment, participants' PTSD symptoms were assessed using a clinical interview and their sleep was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Objective sleep, self-reported sleep, and PTSD symptoms were then assessed over a 1-week period using actigraphy and daily diaries. RESULT(S): Consistent with previous research, women in the study exhibited total sleep time (TST), sleep efficiency (SE), and sleep onset latency (SOL) sleep state misperception. For TST and SE, but not SOL, discrepancies between actigraphy and the PSQI were associated with each clinician-rated PTSD symptom cluster, whereas discrepancies between actigraphy and daily diary were only associated with clinician-rated reexperiencing symptoms. The only self-reported PTSD symptom that was uniquely associated with sleep state misperception was nightmares. This association was no longer significant after controlling for sleep-related anxiety. CONCLUSION(S): Results suggest that women with more severe reexperiencing symptoms of PTSD, particularly nightmares, may be more likely to exhibit TST and SE sleep state misperception, perhaps due to associated sleep-related anxiety.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,"actimetry;adult;anxiety;article;clinical article;controlled study;female;human;human tissue;interview;*nightmare;Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index;*posttraumatic stress disorder;sleep efficiency;sleep latency;sleep time;Sleep Disorders, Intrinsic;Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic;Sleep",,,arditte_ptsd_2023,Exploring Predictors of Sleep State Misperception in Women with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder,"Hall et al., 2022",USA,,,,1,,,,,,women with PTSD secondary to interpersonal violence,women; post-traumatic stress disorder,adults,,women,post-traumatic stress disorder,,,n/a,n/a,45,Actigraphy,,,1,1,,,,Motionlogger Basic,,,UCSD,,,,,Action-W analysis software (v2.0),Action W,n/a,,,,,,,,,n/a,n/a,,"TST, SOL, SE",,,,standard,,actigraphy-defined,,,,TST/TIB*100,,,1,1,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,n/a,,,sleep diary,generic,1,,,,,,,,,,7 nights,7,matched,1,,,not reported,direct question (in hours),question,,1,,,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"(sTST-oTST)/oTST, oSOL-sSOL, oSE-sSE",1,MI_R,dSOL_R,dSE_R,,,,,,,0,1,,1,,,"combination score (MI), algebraic difference score",mean values,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,n/a,"ANOVA for TST, SE, and SOL as function of assessment method",n/a,,,,,

In this study, we subjected 22 healthy males (aged 21.8+/-1.9 years) to a 40-min nap trial followed by 80min of wakefulness repeated over 28h, and investigated the relationship between various sleep parameters and the discrepancy (DELTAST) of time estimation ability (TEA) during sleep, defined by the difference between actual sleep time (ST) and subjective sleep time (sub-ST) in each nap interval. Both ST and sub-ST were significant diurnal fluctuations with the peak in the early morning (9h after dim-light melatonin onset time, 2h after nadir time of core body temperature rhythm), and subjective sleep duration was estimated to be longer than actual times in all nap intervals (sub-ST>ST). There were significant diurnal fluctuations in discrepancy (sub-ST-ST) of TEA during sleep, and the degree of discrepancy correlated positively with increase in the amount of REM sleep and decrease in the amount of slow-wave sleep. These findings suggest that human TEA operates at a certain level of discrepancy during sleep, and that this discrepancy might be related to the biological clock and its associated sleep architecture.

As sleep disorders have numerous negative effects on the organism, there have been efforts to implement sleep-promoting strategies into practice. When comparing the effectiveness of such measures, sleep quality assessment itself is a considerable problem., OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to assess the quality and quantity of night sleep in ICU patients simultaneously with actigraphy (ACT) and the Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire (RCSQ). The secondary goals were to test the performance and effectiveness of the above methods and to verify correlations between selected RCSQ items and actigraph parameters., METHODS: A single-center prospective observational study (20 patients staying in a Interdisciplinary Intensive Care Unit). The quality of sleep was assessed using a Czech version of the RCSQ and ACT. The obtained data were analyzed and their dependence or correlations were verified by selected statistical tests., RESULTS: The mean RCSQ score was 47.6 (SD 24.4). The worst results were found for sleep latency (44.4; SD 31.2); the best results were for sleep quality (50.2; SD 29.4). The mean sleep effciency measured with ACT reached 86.6% (SD 9.2); the mean number of awakenings per night was 17.1 (SD 8.5). The RCSQ total parameter with a cutoff of 50 (RCSQ total = 50 good sleep / RCSQ total < 50 poor sleep) was shown to be suitable for discrimination of subjectively perceived sleep quality in ICU patients. However, the study failed to show statistically significant relations between subjectively perceived sleep quality (RCSQ) and ACT measurements., CONCLUSION: The RCSQ appears to be a suitable instrument for assessing night sleep quality in ICU patients. On the other hand, the study showed a very low level of agreement between subjective sleep quality assessment and objective ACT measurements. The main drawback of ACT is low reliability of obtained data. Further research is needed to determine its role in sleep quality assessment in the ICU setting.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,Questionnaires;Sleep,,,locihova_sleep_2020,Sleep quality assessment in intensive care: actigraphy vs. Richards-Campbell sleep questionnaire,"Locihova et al., 2020",Czech Republic,,,1,,,,,,,patients admitted to an intensive care unit of a hospital,intensive care unit,adults,,,intensive care unit,,,n/a,n/a,20,Actigraphy,,,1,1,,,,ActiGraph wGT3X-BT,,,Cole-Kripke,,,,,ActiLife software (version 6.13.3),ActiLife,externally defined,,,,,1,,,,n/a,n/a,,"TST, WASO, SE, awakenings",,,,standard,,,,,,TST/TIB*100,,standard,1,,1,1,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,n/a,,,Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire (RCSQ) -- visual analogue scale,Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire (RCSQ),,,,1,,,,,,,1 night,1,matched,1,,,n/a,visual,visual,,,,1,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,0,,,,,,,,,,n/a,,,,,,n/a,single night,,,1,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,n/a,spearman correlations.

Design Prospective study. Setting Outpatient geriatric sleep clinic. Participants Individuals aged 60 and older referred for insomnia complaints or suspected sleep apnea (N = 135). Measurements Tests included clinical interview, sleepiness scale, anxiety and depression scale, Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and overnight polysomnography, followed by multiple sleep latency tests. At the end of each of four nap opportunities, participants answered whether they had slept during the test. Nap underperception was defined as two or more unperceived naps. Results Of the 105 participants who napped at least twice, 42 (40%) did not perceive at least two naps. These participants had lower MMSE scores (P =.01) and were more likely to be taking benzodiazepines (P =.008) than the 63 participants who did not underperceive their naps but had similar demographic characteristics, sleep diagnoses, depression and anxiety scores, and polysomnography measures. Both groups had similarly short mean daytime sleep latencies (9.7 +/- 4.5 minutes and 9.8 +/- 3.7 minutes), but participants who underperceived their naps scored lower on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (5.6 +/- 4.0, vs 9.6 +/- 4.8, P <.001). An ISI of 11 or greater, a MMSE score of 26 or less, and a sleepiness score of 8 or less were each independently associated with underperception of naps. The combination of these three factors yielded a positive predictive value of 93% and a negative predictive value of 71% for nap underperception. Conclusion Older adults referred for sleep consultation with cognitive impairment and greater insomnia symptoms frequently underperceive naps, leading them to underestimate their level of sleepiness. In such cases, objective measures of daytime sleepiness would be better than the Epworth Sleepiness Scale.Â© 2015, Copyright the Authors Journal compilation Â© 2015, The American Geriatrics Society.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,adult;anxiety assessment;article;*cognitive defect/di [Diagnosis];controlled clinical trial;controlled study;daytime somnolence/di [Diagnosis];demography;diagnostic test accuracy study;disease association;Epworth sleepiness scale;female;geriatric assessment;Geriatric Depression Scale;geriatric hospital;geriatric patient;human;independent variable;*insomnia/di [Diagnosis];Insomnia Severity Index;interview;major clinical study;male;middle aged;Mini Mental State Examination;naturalistic inquiry;night sleep;outpatient department;patient referral;perception;*perception disorder/di [Diagnosis];polysomnography;predictive value;prospective study;sleep;*sleep disorder/di [Diagnosis];sleep disordered breathing/di [Diagnosis];sleep medicine;sleep parameters;antidepressant agent;benzodiazepine;Goldberg Anxiety Scale;nap;*sleep state misperception/di [Diagnosis];Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders,,,nguyen-michel_underperception_2015,Underperception of naps in older adults referred for a sleep assessment: An insomnia trait and a cognitive problem?,"Nguyen-Michel et al., 2015",France,,,,,,,,,,older adults referred for insomnia complaints or suspected sleep apnoea,older adults; individuals referred for PSG,older adults,,,referred for PSG,,,n/a,n/a,135,PSG (MSLT),1,1,,,,,,n/a,,,,,,,,n/a,n/a,n/a,,,,,,,,,AASM,in-lab,MSLT,Perception of sleep during nap (binary),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,n/a,,,technician question: fallen asleep yes/no,generic,,,,,,,1,,,,4 nap opportunities,4,matched,1,,,n/a,n/a,,,,,,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,0,,,,,,,,,,n/a,,,,,,n/a,conditions to form groups (perceived at least two naps/ perceived all or all but one nap),,,,,,,,,conditions to form groups (perceived at least two naps/ perceived all or all but one nap),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,n/a,n/a,did or did not perceive naps --> binary variable --> correlated with clinical measures,,,1,,

Therefore, we believe that investigating this phenomenon is the best way to understand some of the mechanisms involved in several sleep disturbances, particularly insomnias. Objective(s): The objective of our study was to evaluate sleep perception in insomniacs, sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) patients, and healthy volunteers. Our hypothesis was that insomniacs have less sleep perception than healthy individuals and patients with sleep respiratory disorders. Method(s): We studied 199 individuals who were divided into the following four groups: (1) insomnia group; (2) patients with sleep-disordered breathing; (3) patients with insomnia complaints and an associated sleep respiratory disorder; and (4) healthy individuals with no sleep complaints. All patients were subjected to polysomnography (PSG) followed by a questionnaire addressing their perception about the previous night's sleep. In addition to analysis of all sleep parameters, we determined sleep perception as the percentage of the ratio between total sleep time perceived by the patient and the total sleep time obtained by PSG. Result(s): Sleep perception was significantly lower in insomnia patients than in sleep-disordered breathing patients or the normal group. In addition, no significant differences across the four groups were observed in sleep efficiency and total sleep time. Conclusion(s): The results showed that the reported sleep perception of insomniacs is lower than that of sleep-disordered breathing patients or normal individuals. We believe that sleep perception is as important as other commonly measured parameters, such as sleep efficiency. Â© 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we test the hypothesis that tau and Ab predict unique impairments in objective and self-perceived human sleep under real-life, free-living conditions. Eighty-nine male and female cognitively healthy older adults received 18F-FTP-tau and 11C-PIB-Ab PET imaging, 7 nights of sleep actigraphy and questionnaire measures, and neurocognitive assessment. Tau burden, but not Ab, was associated with markedly worse objective sleep. In contrast, Ab and tau were associated with worse self-reported sleep quality. Of clinical relevance, Ab burden predicted a unique perceptual mismatch between objective and subject sleep evaluation, with individuals underestimating their sleep. The magnitude of this mismatch was further predicted by worse executive function. Thus, early-stage tau and Ab deposition are linked with distinct phenotypes of real-world sleep impairment, one that includes a cognitive misperception of their own sleep health.Copyright Â© 2021 Society for Neuroscience.

A.",http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed16&NEWS=N&AN=606857388,,"BACKGROUND: Worldwide, there are more than 35 million individuals diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. Many of these individuals are cared for at home by unpaid caregivers who often report high levels of depressive symptoms and depression. The majority of studies conducted to predict which caregivers are at risk for depression have examined non-modifiable risk factors. Therefore, it is important to discover modifiable factors that may be associated with risk for depression in caregivers., OBJECTIVES: The aims of this research were to identify a set of factors that are modifiable and known to be associated with high levels of depression/depressive symptomology (D/DS) in other populations and to determine whether these factors are predictive of D/DS after controlling for non-modifiable, demographic, and clinical factors., DESIGN: Secondary data analysis., METHODS: Fifty-three participants provided direct care to a person with dementia with night-time activity. Inclusion criteria included not undergoing treatment for sleep disorders; living with the care recipient; and a Mini-Mental Status Exam score > 27. Baseline data collected by questionnaires, sleep diary and actigraphy., RESULTS: In multivariate analyses of the modifiable factors, only high levels of negative affect predicted higher levels of depressive symptomatology. When non-modifiable factors were included in the model, negative affect and high levels of perceived caregiver burden predicted 52.6% of the variance in depressive symptomology. In secondary analyses, wake after sleep onset misperception was associated with higher depression scores., CONCLUSIONS: While negative affect had a moderate effect on depressive symptoms, modifiable factors often associated with depressive symptoms in other studies were not associated with caregiver depression in this study. Possibly caregivers' overall poor sleep causes a floor effect and masks a potential relationship., IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Both caregivers' affect and perceived burden are strongly related to depressive symptoms, so healthcare practitioners need to frequently assess both so as to provide timely interventions.Copyright Â© 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,actimetry;adult;affect;aged;caregiver;dementia;depression/ep [Epidemiology];human;middle aged;*nursing;*psychology;questionnaire;risk factor;sleep;very elderly;Dementia;Depression;Caregivers,,,daoust_depression_2015,Depression in informal caregivers of persons with dementia,"D'Aoust et al., 2015",USA,,,1,1,,,,,,informal caregivers of persons with dementia,caregivers,adults,,,caregivers,,,n/a,n/a,53,Actigraphy,,,1,1,,,,Actiwatch-L,,,Actiware (not reported),,,,,Actiware software,Actiware,sleep diary,,1,,,,,,,n/a,n/a,,"TST, SOL, WASO, SE",,,,standard,,actigraphy-defined,,,,TST/TIB*100,,,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,n/a,,,sleep diary,generic,1,,,,,,,,,,7 nights,7,matched,1,,,not reported,calculated (not reported),calculated (not reported),,,1,,n/a,calculated (not reported),calculated,calculated (not reported),oWASO-sWASO,1,dWASO_R,,,,,,,,,0,1,,,,,algebraic difference score,mean values,,1,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,n/a,pearson correlations,n/a,,,,,

Correlates of subjective-objective sleep discrepancy included the presence of an insomnia diagnosis and impaired memory, particularly delayed memory. Conclusion(s): These findings are important because subjective underestimation of symptoms in older adults with memory impairments may result in sleep disturbances going unrecognized in clinical practice; on the other hand, an insomnia disorder may be a possible remediable contribution to subjective overestimation of sleep disturbances.Copyright Â© The Author(s) 2017.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,actimetry;aged;anxiety disorder;article;cognition;depression;exercise;female;human;insomnia;major clinical study;male;*mild cognitive impairment/di [Diagnosis];Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index;prevalence;priority journal;*sleep disorder;sleep quality;*subsyndromal depression/di [Diagnosis];Sleep,,,dinapoli_mci_2017,Subjective-Objective Sleep Discrepancy in Older Adults with MCI and Subsyndromal Depression,"Dinapoli et al., 2017",Italy,,,1,,,,,,,older adults with mild cognitive impairment and subsyndromal depression,mild cognitive impairment; subsyndromal depression,older adults,,,mild cognitive impairment,,,n/a,n/a,59,Actigraphy,,,1,1,,,,SenseWear MF Armband,,,SenseWear,,,,,SenseWear 7.0 software,SenseWear,not reported,,,,,,,1,,n/a,n/a,,"sleep quality [dichotomised PSQI sleep quality item, trichotomised SE]",,,,,,,,,,Categorical (3-levels),,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,dichotomised PSQI sleep quality item,index,SE (trichotomised),SE,n/a,,,"PSQI, subjective sleep quality item (dichotomised)",Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI),1,,,,1,,,,,,4-10 nights,4,habitual,,1,,TST/TIB * 100 (trichotomised),n/a,,,,,,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,0,,,,,,,,,,n/a,,,,,,n/a,mean values,,1,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,n/a,pearson correlation,sleep discrepancy category score based on dichotomised PSQI item and trichotomised SE,,,,,

Since there is evidence to suggest that individuals respond differently to sleep loss, there has been a recent focus on trying to account for individual differences. One possible approach could use past behaviour to predict future responses to similar working conditions. This study investigated the predictive value of sleep timing and duration data for a particular individual on a break between shifts relative to data from their colleagues. Sleep diaries and wrist actigraphy were collected from 306 international long-haul pilots for at least 2-weeks. Fifty layovers, equivalent in origin and destination, length and timing, were completed twice by individual pilots. Matched layovers done by other pilots (n=2311) were also identified. Layover periods were analysed for minute-by-minute correspondence of sleep or wake (yes/no), and total sleep time (TST). Using an individual's own data improved concordance by approximately 5% relative to using a large sample of different pilots, and by 10% relative to using a random sample of 50 different pilots. Using an individual's own TST to predict their TST on an equivalent layover yielded an r value of 0.83, compared to r=0.78 when data from a colleague was used, and r=0.73 using different pilots in a random sample of equivalent size. The mean difference in TST using pilots' own data was <20 min, compared to <40 min using data from colleagues. However, the confidence limits on these differences were large (up to 8h). Results suggest that for international pilots on specific layover patterns, knowing the past behaviour of an individual may only represent a modest improvement over knowing the length and timing of a colleague's sleep, when it comes to predicting their sleep behaviour.","1879-2057     Dorrian, Jillian     Darwent, David     Dawson, Drew     Roach, Gregory D     Journal Article     Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't     England     2012/01/18     Accid Anal Prev. 2012 Mar;45 Suppl:17-21. doi: 10.1016/j.aap.2011.09.019.

A two-step retrospective (study 1) and prospective (study 2) validation study was carried out. Study 1 included 288 normal subjects [176 females and 112 males, mean age 58.5 years, standard deviation (SD) 7.23]. Study 2 included 159 patients (98 females and 61 males; mean age 49.1 years, SD 12.71) with primary insomnia. Participants underwent a full-night polysomnographic study, followed by a morning assessment of subjective sleep parameters. A misperception index (MI) was computed using the following formula: MI = [objective total sleep time (oTST)-subjective total sleep time (sTST)]/oTST. The statistical properties of this index were analysed in detail in both groups. In controls, the Bland-Altman test demonstrated the reliability of this index for values of oTST >120 min. Healthy subjects estimated their sleep time correctly, while insomniacs largely underestimated their sleep time. Statistical analysis of the distribution of MI in insomnia patients disclosed the presence of two subgroups, one with moderate sleep misperception (132 patients) and the other with high sleep misperception (27 patients). The latter presented MI values >=0.9, exhibiting statistical properties different from those with MI <0.9 and from normal subjects. The MI gives a reliable and immediate description of sleep misperception in healthy and insomnia subjects. Its application supports the existence of the high misperception of insomnia as a separate pathological entity.

The reliability of the subjective statements reports on disturbed night sleep and alertness in the daytime was assessed by their correlation to the objective indicators in patients with mild depression. Method. Among patients with depression, altogether 28 patients with insomnia were examined. Their answers to typical questions, as they are used during a psychiatric interview, were scored. In parallel, night sleep quality and alertness level in the daytime were objectively estimated by means of polygraphic recording. Results. The subjective statements on the type of insomnia, the estimated time of falling asleep, frequent awakenings and occurrence of disturbing dreams seem to be unreliable. Similarly, the results were disappointing when the patients were asked about alertness disturbances in the daytime. An unexpected finding was the lack of any significant correlation to the scores obtained by means of Epworth's scale. Among the factors possibly influencing the patients' reports, age, sex, coffee intake and also chronic administration of sedatives or hypnotics showed a low correlation with the sleep and alertness indicators. Conclusion. The statistical evaluation indicated rather poor agreement between the subjective and objective items. The statistical evaluation suggested that anxiety and depression significantly influence reports on sleep quality and alertness disturbances in the daytime.

In addition, TSTbed/wake was calculated as the difference between bedtime and waketime, minus the time to fall asleep, from the PSQI. Univariate regression analyses were performed to assess the relation between TSTobj and TSTPSQI and TSTbed/wake and compare the relation by sex, race, and ethnicity. Bland-Altman tests were done to assess bias by sex, race/ethnicity, weight status, and sleep quality., RESULTS: TSTbed/wake correlated with TSTobj (r = .57, P < .0001). TSTPSQI and TSTbed/wake were greater than TSTobj (0.63 +/- 0.99 hours and 0.79 +/- 0.76 hours, respectively, both P < .0001). The difference between TSTPSQI and TSTobj did not vary by sex (beta = .12, P = .52), race/ethnicity (beta = .15, P = .48), age (beta = -.01, P = .27), or body mass index (beta = .04, P = .13) whereas that between TSTbed/wake and TSTobj varied by age (beta = -.020, P = .0051), BMI (beta = .054, P = .0021), race/ethnicity (beta = .36, P = .021), and sleep efficiency (beta = -.089, P < .0001)., CONCLUSIONS: Calculating TST using self-reported bedtimes and wake times provided TST estimate that correlated with TSTobj but greater over-reporting occurred in younger and heavier individuals, non-whites or Hispanics, and those with low sleep efficiency. In clinical and research settings, asking individuals to report bedtimes, wake times, and length of time to fall asleep may more accurately estimate TST than asking about sleep duration alone.

Sleep discrepancy (SD) was defined as the difference between the sleep duration derived from the PSG and self-report questionnaires. SD > 2 h was classified as high SD. Self-report questionnaires, and polysomnography (PSG) were performed before 4 weeks of group CBT-I. Statistical analyses were performed to investigate the association of SD with baseline characteristics and CBT-I results, and compare intergroup difference of pre and post-treatment of high SD and low SD., RESULTS: Patients in the high SD group reported poor subjective sleep, such as lower sleep quality, shorter sleep duration, longer sleep latency, and lower sleep efficiency. However, they had longer sleep duration, higher sleep efficiency in the PSG. There were 35% males in low SD group, but no males in high SD group. After 4 weeks of group CBT-I, SD was positively associated with the effect of CBT-I on subjective total sleep time (r = 0.499, p < 0.006) and sleep efficiency (r = 0.463, p = 0.01) after adjusting age, sex and apnea-hypopnea index., CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that patients in the high SD group may respond better to CBT-I than those in lower SD group.

E-mail: staheri@me.com","Study Objectives:The majority of adolescent sleep research has utilized self-reported sleep duration and some have based information on a solitary question. Whilst some have claimed to have validated sleep survey data with objective actigraphy measures in adolescents, the statistical approach applied only demonstrates the strength of the association between subjective and objective sleep duration data and does not reflect if these different methods actually agree. Method(s):Data were collected as part of the Midlands Adolescents Schools Sleep Education Study (MASSES). Adolescents (n=225) aged 11-13 years provided estimates for weekday, weekend and combined sleep duration based on self-reported survey data, a 7-day sleep diary, and wrist-worn actigraphy. Result(s):We assessed the strength of the relationship as well as agreement levels between subjective and objectively determined sleep duration (weekday, weekend and combined). Subjective diary sleep duration was significantly correlated with actigraphy estimates for weekday and weekend sleep duration r=0.30, p<=0.001 and r=0.31, p<=0.001 respectively. Pitman's test demonstrated no significant difference in the variance between weekend sleep duration (r=0.09, p=0.16) and combined sleep duration (r=0.12, p=0.08) indicating acceptable agreement between actigraphy and sleep diary sleep duration only. Self-reported sleep duration estimates (weekday, weekend and combined) did not agree with actigraphy determined sleep duration. Conclusion(s):Sleep diaries are a cost-effective alternative to survey/questionnaire data. Self-reported measures of sleep duration in adolescents do not agree with actigraphy measures and should be avoided where possible. Previous adolescent sleep studies that have utilized self-reported survey data may not provide a complete representation of sleep on the outcome measure of interest.

Cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is the most effective treatment for insomnia and also reduces the degree of sleep underestimation. Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a highly prevalent sleep disorder characterised by frequent narrowing (hypopnoea) and closure (apnoea) of the upper airway during sleep. Comorbid insomnia and sleep apnoea (COMISA) is a prevalent and debilitating disorder. No study has investigated subjectively (sleep diary) versus objectively (polysomnography) measured sleep discrepancies (SOSD) in individuals with COMISA before or following CBT-I. This randomised waitlist-controlled trial investigated SOSD in 145 participants with COMISA before and 6-weeks after CBT-I (n = 72) versus control (n = 73). All participants were studied prior to continuous positive airway pressure treatment for sleep apnoea. At baseline, participants underestimated their total sleep time (mean +/- SD -51.9 +/- 94.1 min) and sleep efficiency (-9.6 +/- 18.3%), and overestimated sleep onset latency (34.5 +/- 86.1 min; all p = < 0.001). Mixed models indicated a main effect of time on reduction of SOSD in both groups, but no between-group difference in the reduction of any SOSD parameters. These findings may indicate that untreated OSA contributes to a discrepancy between perceived and objective sleep parameters in people with COMISA that is not amenable to CBT-I alone (ACTRN12613001178730).","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders,,,bensen-boakes_2022,The Effect of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) on Subjective-Objective Sleep Discrepancy in Individuals with Co-Morbid Insomnia and Sleep Apnoea: A Randomised Controlled Trial,"Bensen-Boakes et al., 2022",Australia,,,1,1,,,,1,,participants with comborbid insomnia and OSA,insomnia; obstructive sleep apnoea,adults,,,insomnia,obstructive sleep apnoea,,72 received CBT-I,73 waitlist control,145,PSG,1,1,,,,,,n/a,,,,,,,,n/a,n/a,n/a,,,,,,,,,AASM,in-lab,nocturnal,"TST, SOL, WASO, SE",,,,standard,,first epoch of any sleep stage,,,,TST/TIB*100,,,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,n/a,,,morning questionnaire,generic,,,1,,,,,,,,"1+1 nights (baseline, follow-up)",2,matched,1,,,TST/TIB * 100,direct question,question,,1,,,n/a,direct question,direct question,direct question,"sTST-oTST, sSOL-oSOL, sWASO-oWASO, sSE-oSE; (sTST-oTST)/oTST*100, (sSOL-oSOL)/oSOL*100, (sWASO-oWASO)/oWASO*100, (sSE-oSE)/oSE*100",1,dTST,dSOL,dWASO,dSE,MI_R100,MI_SOL_R100,MI_WASO_R100,MI_SE_R100,,0,1,,,1,,"algebraic difference scores, misperception index",linear mixed models,,,,,,,1,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,n/a,paired samples t-tests,n/a,,,,,

Methods A total of 148 inpatients with schizophrenia admitted to Beijing HuiLongGuan Hospital were enrolled in this study. The quality of objective sleep was assessed by polysomnography (PSG). On the second day after the successful completion of the PSG evaluation, an interview was arranged to collect patients' recorded subjective evaluation on sleep time, sleep latency, and wake times. Demographic information was collected from an interview, medical records were reviewed, and psychiatric symptoms were assessed using the Positive And Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS). Results The main finding of this study was that schizophrenic patients exhibited sleep state misperception with a pattern of overestimation of total sleep time (TST) as well as sleep efficiency (SE), and an underestimation of sleep onset latency (SOL). Regarding the +/- standard deviation of the differences between subjective and objective TST as a clinical acceptable range, the patients were divided into three groups: The overestimate group, the normal group, and the underestimate group. The differences of total PANSS score, especially the PANSS-N score in the overestimate group, the normal group and the underestimate group were significant, and there were significant differences between the overestimate group and the other groups. Conclusion A comprehensive evaluation of the subjective and objective sleep quality in patients with schizophrenia is needed, especially when negative symptoms are severe.Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Inc.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,"adult;article;controlled study;DSM-IV;female;human;major clinical study;male;mental disease;*perception;polysomnography;Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale;*schizophrenia/dt [Drug Therapy];schizophrenia/dt [Drug Therapy];*sleep quality;sleep time;neuroleptic agent/dt [Drug Therapy];Schizophrenia;Sleep Disorders, Intrinsic;Sleep",,,bian_2016,Sleep state misperception in schizophrenia: Are negative symptoms at work?,"Bian et al., 2016",China,,,1,1,,,,,,inpatients with schizophrenia,schizophrenia,adults,,,schizophrenia,,,n/a,n/a,148,PSG,1,1,,,,,,n/a,,,,,,,,n/a,n/a,n/a,,,,,,,,,not reported,in-lab,,"TST, SOL, SE",,,,standard,,not reported,,,,TST/TIB*100,,,1,1,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,n/a,,,morning questionnaire,generic,,,1,,,,,,,,1 night,1,matched,1,,,TST/TIB * 100,direct question,question,,1,,,LO-RT,n/a,n/a,n/a,"TST difference score (minuend not reported), to form three groups based on standard deviation",1,not reported,,,,,,,,,0,1,,,,,difference score trichotomised,single night,,,1,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,n/a,bland altman,n/a,,,,,

The participants were classified as normo-estimators (estimation of TST < +/- 60 min), under-estimators (underestimation of TST >= 60 min), or over-estimators (overestimation of TST >= 60 min). The standardized SF-36 QOL scores were compared among the three groups. An adjusted partial correlation analysis was conducted between SOD and QOL., RESULTS: Of the 2540 participants, 1617 (63.7%), 433 (17.0%), and 490 (19.3%) were assigned to the normo-, under-, and over-estimator groups, respectively. The bodily pain and social functioning components of the SF-36 score were significantly lower in the under-estimators than in the normo-estimators, whereas the physical functioning component was significantly lower in the over-estimators than in the normo-estimators. The absolute value of SOD in the TST showed a significant negative correlation with the physical and mental components of the SF-36., CONCLUSIONS: QOL was significantly better in the normo-estimator than in the other groups and linearly correlated with the absolute value of SOD. This study suggests that a high prevalence of positive and negative sleep misperception in a community population can be a potential factor associated with poor QOL and potential comorbidities.

We examined whether opioid dose and age interact in predicting magnitude or direction of discrepancies. Participants (N = 199, M = 51.5 years, SD = 11.7) with FM and insomnia completed 14 days of diaries and actigraphy. Multiple regressions determined whether average opioid dose and its interaction with age predicted magnitude or direction of diary/actigraphy discrepancies in sleep onset latency (SOL), wake after sleep onset (WASO) and sleep efficiency (SE), controlling for sex, use of sleep medication, evening pain and total sleep time. Higher opioid dose predicted greater magnitude of discrepancy in SOL and SE. Opioid dose interacted with age to predict direction but not magnitude of discrepancy in SOL and SE. Specifically, higher opioid use was associated with better subjective (shorter SOL, higher SE) than objective reports of sleep among younger adults, and longer subjective than objectively measured SOL among older adults. Opioid dose did not predict magnitude or direction of WASO discrepancies. In FM, a higher opioid dose increases diary/actigraphy SOL and SE discrepancies, and direction of discrepancies may depend on age. We speculate that increased opioid use combined with age-related factors, such as slow wave sleep disruption, increased awakenings and/or cognitive decline, may impact perceived sleep.Copyright Â© 2018 European Sleep Research Society","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,*actimetry;adult;aged;arousal;article;cognitive behavioral therapy;female;*fibromyalgia/dt [Drug Therapy];human;*insomnia/th [Therapy];major clinical study;male;mental deterioration;priority journal;*sleep;sleep latency;sleep time;slow wave sleep;*opiate/dt [Drug Therapy];Fibromyalgia,,,curtis_2019,Discrepancies in sleep diary and actigraphy assessments in adults with fibromyalgia: Associations with opioid dose and age,"Curtis et al., 2019",USA,,,,1,,,,,,participants with fibromyalgia and insomnia,insomnia; fibromyalgia,adults,,,insomnia,fibromyalgia,,n/a,n/a,199,Actigraphy,,,1,1,,,,Actiwatch 2,,,Actiware (not reported),,,,,Actiware Sleep Analysis Software v.5.3.2,Actiware,sleep diary,,1,,,,,,,n/a,n/a,,"SOL, WASO, SE",,,,,,actigraphy-defined,,,,TST/TIB*100,,,,1,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,n/a,,,sleep diary,generic,1,,,,,,,,,,14 night,14,matched,1,,,TST/TIB * 100,direct question (implied),question,,1,,,direct question (implied),direct question (implied),direct question,direct question (implied),"oSOL-sSOL, oWASO-sWASO, oSE-sSE, |oSOL-sSOL|, |oWASO-sWASO|, |oSE-sSE|",1,dSOL_R,dWASO_R,dSE_R,absSOL,absWASO,absSE,,,,0,1,1,,,,"algebraic difference score, absolute difference score",mean values,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,n/a,n/a,n/a,,,,,

E-mail: ashlee.b.mckeon.mil@mail.mil","Background: The Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) Operational Research Kit-Actigraphy (WORK-A) is a set of unique practice parameters and actigraphy-derived measures for the analysis of operational military sleep patterns. The WORK-A draws on best practices from the literature and comprises 15 additional descriptive variables. Here, we demonstrate the WORK-A with a sample of United States Army Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) cadets (n = 286) during a month-long capstone pre-commissioning training exercise. Method(s): The sleep of ROTC cadets (n = 286) was measured by Philips Actiwatch devices during the 31-day training exercise. The preliminary effectiveness of the WORK-A was tested by comparing differences in sleep measures collected by Actiwatches as calculated by Philips Actiware software against WORK-A-determined sleep measures and self-report sleep collected from a subset of ROTC cadets (n = 140). Result(s): Actiware sleep summary statistics were significantly different from WORK-A measures and self-report sleep (all P <= 0.001). Bedtimes and waketimes as determined by WORK-A major sleep intervals showed the best agreement with self-report bedtime (22:21 +/- 1:30 vs. 22:13 +/- 0:40, P = 0.21) and waketime (04:30 +/- 2:17 vs. 04:31 +/- 0:47, P = 0.68). Though still significantly different, the discrepancy was smaller between the WORK-A measure of time in bed (TIB) for major sleep intervals (352 +/- 29 min) and self-report nightly sleep duration (337 +/- 57 min, P = 0.006) than that between the WORK-A major TIB and Actiware TIB (177 +/- 42, P <= 0.001). Conclusion(s): Default actigraphy methods are not the most accurate methods for characterizing soldier sleep, but reliable methods for characterizing operational sleep patterns is a necessary first step in developing strategies to improve soldier readiness. The WORK-A addresses this knowledge gap by providing practice parameters and a robust variety of measures with which to profile sleep behavior in service members.

We aimed to evaluate if sleep perception is affected by the severity of OSA. Methods We performed a 3-month cross-sectional study of Brazilian adults undergoing overnight polysomnography (PSG). TST was objectively assessed from PSG and by a self-reported questionnaire (subjective measurement). Sleep perception index (SPI) was defined by the ratio of subjective and objective values. Diagnosis of OSA was based on an apnea/hypopnea index (AHI) * 5.0/h, being its severity classified according to AHI thresholds: 5.0-14.9/h (mild OSA), 15.0-29.9/h (moderate OSA), and * 30.0/h (severe OSA). Results Overall, 727 patients were included (58.0% males). A significant difference was found in SPI between non-OSA and OSA groups (p = 0.014). Mean SPI values significantly decreased as the OSA severity increased: without OSA (100.1 +/- 40.9%), mild OSA (95.1 +/- 24.6%), moderate OSA (93.5 +/- 25.2%), and severe OSA (90.6 +/- 28.2%), p = 0.036. Using logistic regression, increasing SPI was associated with a reduction in the likelihood of presenting any OSA (p = 0.018), moderate/severe OSA (p = 0.019), and severe OSA (p = 0.028). However, insomnia was not considered as an independent variable for the presence of any OSA, moderate/severe OSA, and severe OSA (all p-values > 0.05). Conclusion In a clinical referral cohort, SPI significantly decreases with increasing OSA severity, but is not modified by the presence of insomnia symptoms.Copyright Â© 2020 Public Library of Science.

This study examined the impact and durability of cognitive-behavioural therapy for insomnia on improving the accuracy of sleep and wake perceptions in older adults, and tested whether changes in sleep quality were related to changes in the accuracy of sleep/wake perceptions. One-hundred and fifty-nine older veterans (97% male, mean age 72.2 years) who met diagnostic criteria for insomnia disorder were randomized to: (1) cognitive-behavioural therapy for insomnia (n = 106); or (2) attention control (n = 53). Assessments were conducted at baseline, post-treatment, 6-months and 12-months follow-up. Sleep measures included objective (via wrist actigraphy) and subjective (via self-report diary) total sleep time and total wake time, along with Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index score. Discrepancy was computed as the difference between objective and subjective estimates of wake and sleep. Minutes of discrepancy were compared between groups across time, as were the relationships between Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index scores and subsequent changes in discrepancy. Compared with controls, participants randomized to cognitive-behavioural therapy for insomnia became more accurate (i.e. minutes discrepancy was reduced) in their perceptions of sleep/wake at post-treatment, 6-months and 12-months follow-up (p <.05). Improved Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index scores at each study assessment preceded and predicted reduced discrepancy at the next study assessment (p <.05). Cognitive-behavioural therapy for insomnia reduces sleep/wake discrepancy among older adults with insomnia. The reductions may be driven by improvements in sleep quality. Improving sleep quality appears to be a viable path to improving sleep perception and may contribute to the underlying effectiveness of cognitive-behavioural therapy for insomnia.Copyright Â© 2019 European Sleep Research Society","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,actimetry;aged;article;attention;*cognitive behavioral therapy;controlled clinical trial (topic);controlled study;female;follow up;human;*insomnia/th [Therapy];major clinical study;male;*perception;Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index;priority journal;randomized controlled trial;self report;sleep;sleep quality;sleep time;*sleep waking cycle;veteran;wakefulness;Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders;Wakefulness,,,dzierzewski_2019,CBT for late-life insomnia and the accuracy of sleep and wake perceptions: Results from a randomized-controlled trial,"Dzierzewski et al., 2019",USA,,,1,1,,,,1,,older adults with insomnia,older adults; insomnia,older adults,,,insomnia,,,106 randomised to CBT-I,53 to attention control,159,Actigraphy,,,1,1,,,,Actiwatch Spectrum,,,Actiware (not reported),,,,reference provided is SBSM gude to actigraphy--does not specify algorithm; can have an educated guess it is actiware as device Phillips,not reported,not reported,not reported,,,,,,,1,,n/a,n/a,,"TST, sTWT (SOL+WASO+teminal wake)",,,,standard,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,n/a,,,sleep diary,generic,1,,,,,,,,,,"4*7 nights (baseline, post-treatment, 6-month fu, 12-month fu)",28,matched,1,,,n/a,TIB - TWT,TIB-TWT,,,1,,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"sTST-oTST, sTWT-oTWT",1,dTST,dTWT,,,,,,,,0,1,,,,,algebraic difference scores,mean values,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,n/a,one-sample t-test of difference scores,n/a,,,,,

Researchers often employ objective recordings to evaluate sleep patterns, such as actigraphy, whilst clinicians often use subjective ratings, such as the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). As evidence suggests the measures may disagree, we decided to compare subjective (PSQI) and objective (3 weeks of actigraphy) sleep profiles in BD cases and HC (n = 154). We examined whether a dimensional approach helps to illustrate different patterns of sleep disturbances and whether the concordance between subjective and objective recordings varies according to clinical status (BD versus HC). Principal component analysis (PCA) extracted two factors from the PSQI, and separate PCAs of actigraphy recordings extracted two factors for mean values of sleep parameters and one factor for intra-individual variability. Correlational and linear regression analyses of PCA-derived dimensions demonstrated that, in both BD and HC, a PSQI ""Sleep duration-efficiency"" factor was significantly correlated with an actigraphy ""Sleep initiation-duration"" factor. Furthermore, in BD cases only, the PSQI total score and a PSQI ""Sleep Impairments"" factor were each significantly correlated with an actigraphy ""Sleep Variability"" factor. Overall, we found that subjective experiences of sleep may be modulated by different components of objectively recorded sleep in BD compared with HC. Also, the use of PCA enabled us to consider the multi-dimensional nature of subjective sleep, whilst the inclusion of intra-individual sleep variability afforded a more subtle evaluation of objective sleep.Copyright Â© 2021 European Sleep Research Society","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,*actimetry;adult;article;*bipolar disorder;controlled study;*exploratory research;female;human;linear regression analysis;major clinical study;male;*Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index;principal component analysis;sleep disorder;*sleep quality;sleep time;Bipolar Disorder,,,etain_2022,Do self-ratings of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index reflect actigraphy recordings of sleep quality or variability?

Sleep misperception is considered by some investigators a common characteristic of chronic insomnia, whereas others propose it as a separate diagnosis. The frequency and the determinants of sleep misperception in general population samples are unknown. Method(s): A total of 142 insomniacs and 724 controls selected from a general random sample of 1,741 individuals (aged 20 years) underwent a polysomnographic evaluation, completed the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2, and were split into two groups based on their objective sleep duration: ""normal sleep duration"" (6 hours) and ""short sleep duration"" (<6 hours). Result(s): The discrepancy between subjective and objective sleep duration was determined by two independent factors. Short sleepers reported more sleep than they objectively had, and insomniacs reported less sleep than controls with similar objective sleep duration. The additive effect of these two factors resulted in underestimation only in insomniacs with normal sleep duration. Insomniacs with normal sleep duration showed a Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2 profile of high depression and anxiety and low ego strength, whereas insomniacs with short sleep duration showed a profile of a medical disorder. Conclusion(s): Underestimation of sleep duration is prevalent among insomniacs with objective normal sleep duration. Anxious-ruminative traits and poor resources for coping with stress seem to mediate the underestimation of sleep duration. These data further support the validity and clinical utility of objective sleep measures in phenotyping insomnia.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty recruits provided daily rating of perceived exertion (RPE) and differential RPE (d-RPE) for breathlessness and leg muscle exertion each evening. Daily internal workloads determined via heart rate monitors were expressed as Edwards training impulse (TRIMP) and average heart rate. External workloads were determined via global positioning system (PlayerLoadTM) and activity monitors (step count). Subjective sleep quality and duration was monitored in 29 different recruits via a customized questionnaire. Activity monitors assessed objective sleep measures. Linear mixed-models assessed associations between objective and subjective measures. Akaike Information Criterion assessed if the inclusion of d-RPE measures resulted in a more parsimonious model. Mean bias, typical error of the estimate (TEE) and within-subject repeated measures correlations examined agreement between subjective and objective sleep duration. RESULT(S): Conditional R2 for associations between objective and subjective workloads ranged from 0.18 to 0.78, P<0.01, with strong associations between subjective measures of workload and TRIMP (0.65-0.78), average heart rate (0.57-0.73), and PlayerLoadTM (0.54-0.68). Including d-RPE lowered Akaike Information Criterion. The slope estimate between objective and subjective measures of sleep quality was not significant. A trivial relationship (r=0.12; CI -0.03, 0.27) was observed between objective and subjective sleep duration with subjective measures overestimating (mean bias 25min) sleep duration (TEE 41min). CONCLUSION(S): Daily RPE offers a proxy measure of internal workload in Australian Army recruits; however, the current subjective sleep questionnaire should not be considered a proxy measure of objective sleep measures.Copyright Â© The Association of Military Surgeons of the United States 2021.

Theories of insomnia have proposed that perceived sleeplessness triggers excessive intention and effort to sleep, ironically disturbing the normal initiation of sleep. The current study tested this specific association between (mis)perception of sleep and intrinsic motivation to think about sleep.Methods: The sample (nÂ =Â 74) covered students and community living in Munich and surrounds with ages between 18 and 30 years. We assessed the subjective and objective sleep of participants using a sleep diary and actigraphy. Participants also completed a decision-making task (the pay-per-view task), where they had to decide between thinking about sleep vs. eating. As these options were associated with a variable monetary reward, participants typically experienced a conflict between their preferred topic and the reward for their choice.Results: Multilevel logistic regression analyses showed that participants with greater SOL misperception (i.e., longer subjective relative to objective SOL) forgo a greater reward for the opportunity to think about sleep.Limitations: The non-clinical nature of our sample may limit the implication of the findings for clinical levels of insomnia.Conclusions: Results support the cognitive model of insomnia, suggesting that perception of sleeplessness is associated with higher intrinsic motivation to engage in sleep-related thinking.","research.

A high level of intra-individual variability in measures of sleep discrepancy was observed. Multilevel modelling revealed that higher levels of pre-sleep cognitive activity and lower mood upon awakening were significantly and independently predictive of the underestimation of total sleep time. Greater levels of sleep effort predicted overestimation of sleep onset latency.

This phenomenon has been termed ""occult insomnia."" The objective of this study was to determine whether chronic cocaine users experience positive sleep state misperception during abstinence. Method(s): Forty-three cocaine-dependent persons were admitted to an inpatient research facility for 12 days and 11 nights to participate in a treatment study of modafinil. Polysomnographic sleep recordings were performed on study nights 3, 4, 10, and 11, when participants were on average 1 and 2 weeks abstinent from cocaine. Participants also completed sleep diary questionnaires every evening before bed and every morning upon awakening. Polysomnographic and sleep diary measurements of total sleep time, sleep latency, time awake after sleep onset, and time in bed after final awakening were compared. Result(s): Chronic cocaine users accurately reported total sleep time after 1 week of abstinence but overreported total sleep time by an average of 40 min after 2 weeks of abstinence. Underestimating sleep latency and time spent awake after sleep onset were responsible for this difference. Conclusion(s): Positive sleep state misperception is revealed in chronic cocaine users after 2 weeks of abstinence and is consistent with the previously identified ""occult insomnia"" in this population.Copyright Â© 2017, Associated Professional Sleep Societies,LLC.

Previous studies evince that this mismatch is found in both patients with insomnia and in normal sleepers, but the neurophysiological mechanism remains unclear. The aim of the study is to explore the neurophysiological basis of this mechanism, from the perspective of both EEG power and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) fluctuations. Thirty-six healthy young adults participated in the study. Simultaneous EEG and fMRI recordings were conducted while the participants were trying to fall asleep in an MRI scanner at approximately 9:00 pm. They were awakened after achieving stable N1 or N2 sleep, or after 90 min without falling into stable sleep. Next they were asked to recall their conscious experiences from the moment immediately prior to awakening. Sixty-one instances of scheduled awakenings were collected: 21 of these after having achieved stable stage N2 sleep; 12, during stage N1 sleep; and, 20 during the waking state. Relative to those awakenings without subjective-objective discrepancy (n = 27), these awakenings with discrepancy (n = 14) were associated with lower theta power, as well as higher alpha, beta, and gamma power. Moreover, we found that participants who exhibited the discrepancy, compared with those who did not, evinced a higher amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation levels in the prefrontal cortex. These results lend support to the conjecture that the subjective-objective discrepancy is associated with central nervous system hyperarousal.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,Adult;*Brain/dg [Diagnostic Imaging];*Brain/ph [Physiology];Brain Waves/ph [Physiology];*Electroencephalography/mt [Methods];Electroencephalography/st [Standards];Female;Goals;Humans;*Magnetic Resonance Imaging/mt [Methods];Male;Perception/ph [Physiology];Polysomnography/mt [Methods];Polysomnography/st [Standards];Sleep/ph [Physiology];Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders/dg [Diagnostic Imaging];Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders/pp [Physiopathology];*Sleep Stages/ph [Physiology];Surveys and Questionnaires/st [Standards];*Wakefulness/ph [Physiology];Young Adult;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Electroencephalography;Sleep,,,hsiao_2018,The neurophysiological basis of the discrepancy between objective and subjective sleep during the sleep onset period: an EEG-fMRI study,"Hsiao et al., 2018",Taiwan,,,,,,,1,,,healthy young adults,young adults,young adults,,,normative,,,n/a,n/a,36,Simultaneous EEG fMRI,1,,,,EEG,,EEG,n/a,,,,,,,,n/a,n/a,n/a,,,,,,,,,AASM,fMRI,nocturnal nap,n/a,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,n/a,,,interview after awakening following 3 consecutive epochs of N1 or N2,generic,,,,,,,1,,,,1 night,1,n/a,n/a,n/a,,n/a,n/a,,,,,,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,0,,,,,,,,,,n/a,,,,,,n/a,n/a,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,n/a,n/a,binary with/without discrepancy based on were you asleep before being awakened (everyone was asleep).

Method(s): We investigated concordance of self-reported habitual sleep duration compared with actigraphy- and single-night in-home polysomnography (PSG) across white, black, Hispanic, and Chinese participants in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis. Result(s): Among 1910 adults, self-reported sleep duration, determined by differences between bed and wake times, was overestimated in all racial groups compared with PSG and actigraphy. Compared with whites (rho = 0.45), correlations were significantly lower only in blacks (rho = 0.28). Self-reporting bias for total sleep time compared with wrist actigraphy was 66 min (95% confidence interval [CI]: 61-71) for whites, 58 min (95% CI: 48-69) for blacks, 66 min (95% CI: 57-74) for Hispanics, and 60 min (95% CI: 49-70) for Chinese adults. Compared with PSG, self-reporting bias in whites at 73 min (95% CI: 67-79) was higher than in blacks (54 min [95% CI: 42-65]) and Chinese (49 min [95% CI: 37-61]) but not different from Hispanics (67 min [95% CI: 56-78]). Slight agreement/concordance was observed between self-reported and actigraphy-based total sleep time (kw = 0.14 for whites, 0.10 for blacks, 0.17 for Hispanics, and 0.11 for Chinese) and PSG (kw = 0.08 for whites, 0.04 for blacks, 0.05 for Hispanics, and 0.01 for Chinese) across race/ethnicity. Conclusion(s): Self-reported sleep duration overestimated objectively measured sleep across all races, and compared with PSG, overestimation is significantly greater in whites compared with blacks. Larger reporting bias reduces the ability to identify significant associations between sleep duration and health among blacks compared with whites.

We hypothesized that negative SOL discrepancy in PI would be associated with higher relative glucose metabolism during nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep in brain networks involved in conscious awareness, including the salience, left executive control, and default mode networks. Method(s): PI (n = 32) and good sleeper controls (GS; n = 30) completed [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scans during NREM sleep, and relative regional cerebral metabolic rate for glucose (rCMRglc) was measured. Sleep discrepancy was calculated by subtracting PSG-measured SOL on the PET night from corresponding self-report values the following morning. We tested for interactions between group (PI vs. GS) and SOL discrepancy for rCMRglc during NREM sleep using both a region of interest mask and exploratory whole-brain analyses. Result(s): Significant group by SOL discrepancy interactions for rCMRglc were observed in several brain regions (pcorrected < .05 for all clusters). In the PI group, more negative SOL discrepancy (self-reported > PSG-measured SOL) was associated with significantly higher relative rCMRglc in the right anterior insula and middle/posterior cingulate during NREM sleep. In GS, more positive SOL discrepancy (self-reported < PSG-measured SOL) was associated with significantly higher relative rCMRglc in the right anterior insula, left anterior cingulate cortex, and middle/posterior cingulate cortex. Conclusion(s): Although preliminary, these findings suggest regions of the brain previously shown to be involved in conscious awareness, and the perception of PSG-defined states may also be involved in the phenomena of SOL discrepancy.Copyright Â© 2017 Oxford University Press.

E-mail: francesca.siclari@chuv.ch","Feeling awake although sleep recordings indicate clear-cut sleep sometimes occurs in good sleepers and to an extreme degree in patients with so-called paradoxical insomnia. It is unknown what underlies sleep misperception, as standard polysomnographic (PSG) parameters are often normal in these cases. Here we asked whether regional changes in brain activity could account for the mismatch between objective and subjective total sleep times (TST). To set cutoffs and define the norm, we first evaluated sleep perception in a population-based sample, consisting of 2,092 individuals who underwent a full PSG at home and estimated TST the next day. We then compared participants with a low mismatch (normoestimators, n = 1,147, +/-0.5 SD of mean) with those who severely underestimated (n = 52, <2.5th percentile) or overestimated TST (n = 53, >97.5th percentile). Compared with normoestimators, underestimators displayed higher electroencephalographic (EEG) activation (beta/delta power ratio) in both rapid eye movement (REM) and non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, while overestimators showed lower EEG activation (significant in REM sleep). To spatially map these changes, we performed a second experiment, in which 24 healthy subjects and 10 insomnia patients underwent high-density sleep EEG recordings. Similarly to underestimators, patients displayed increased EEG activation during NREM sleep, which we localized to central-posterior brain areas. Our results indicate that a relative shift from low- to high-frequency spectral power in central-posterior brain regions, not readily apparent in conventional PSG parameters, is associated with underestimation of sleep duration. This challenges the concept of sleep misperception, and suggests that instead of misperceiving sleep, insomnia patients may correctly perceive subtle shifts toward wake-like brain activity. Statement of Significance A striking mismatch between subjectively perceived and objectively recorded sleep times sometimes occurs in good sleepers and to an extreme degree in patients with so-called paradoxical insomnia. Here we show that individuals who underestimate their total sleep time display a more ""wake-like,"" activated electroencephalography, while opposite changes are observed in rapid eye movement sleep in subjects who overestimate their sleep time. These findings challenge the concept of sleep misperception, and suggest that instead of misperceiving their sleep duration, insomnia patients may actually correctly perceive subtle shifts toward wake-like brain activity.Copyright Â© Sleep Research Society 2020.

Underestimation and overestimation of sleep state perception were defined as < 80% and > 120%, respectively, of the ratio between subjective and objective total sleep time. An ISI score > 14 indicated clinically significant insomnia and an AHI >= 30 indicated severe OSA. A multinomial logistic regression was conducted with the category of sleep state perception as an outcome variable., RESULTS: Of the 707 patients with OSA, underestimation and overestimation of sleep state perception were noted in 22.5% and 10.6% of subjects, respectively. The median absolute differences (and percentages of the ratio) between subjective and objective total sleep time were 116 min (66.9%) and 87 min (127.3%) in the underestimated and overestimated perception groups, respectively. In the adjusted model, the underestimated group was more likely to have an ISI score > 14 (OR = 1.812, P = .006). The overestimated group was more likely to be older (OR = 1.025, P = .025) and has severe OSA (OR = 1.729, P = .035)., CONCLUSIONS: There are two patterns of sleep state misperception in patients with OSA: underestimation associated with comorbid insomnia symptoms and overestimation associated with severe OSA.

We analyzed the data from a study in which 14 healthy male volunteers had completed a baseline assessment with 8 hr time in bed, a sleep deprivation (40 hr of wakefulness) and a sleep restriction protocol with 5 hr time in bed during 7 nights. In this work, we assessed perception index, derived through dividing the subjectively perceived total sleep time, wake after sleep onset and sleep latency duration by the objectively measured one at each condition. We found that total sleep time was subjectively underestimated at baseline and shifted towards overestimation during sleep restriction and after deprivation. This change in accuracy of subjective estimates was not associated with any changes in sleep architecture or sleep depth. Wake after sleep onset was significantly underestimated only during sleep restriction. Sleep latency was always overestimated subjectively without any significant change in this misperception across conditions. When comparing accuracy of subjective and actimetry estimates, subjective estimates regarding total sleep time and wake after sleep onset deviated less from electroencephalography derived measures during sleep restriction and after deprivation. We conclude that self-assessments and actimetry data of patients with chronic sleep restriction should be interpreted cautiously. The subjectively decreased perception of wake after sleep onset could lead to overestimated sleep efficiency in such individuals, whereas the underestimation of sleep time and overestimation of wake after sleep onset by actimetry could lead to further underestimated sleep duration.Copyright Â© 2018 European Sleep Research Society","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,actimetry;article;chronic patient;crossover procedure;electroencephalography;human;male;night sleep;normal human;perception;*polysomnography;priority journal;*sleep;*sleep deprivation;sleep latency;*sleep parameters;sleep time;stage 1 sleep;wakefulness;Sleep Deprivation;Sleep,,,maric_2019,Exploring the impact of experimental sleep restriction and sleep deprivation on subjectively perceived sleep parameters,"Maric et al., 2019",Switzerland,,,1,1,,1,,,,healthy right-hand males,men,adults,,men,normative,,,n/a,n/a,14,HD-EEG,1,,,,HD-EEG,,HD-EEG,n/a,,,,,,,,n/a,n/a,n/a,,,,,,,,,AASM,in-lab,nocturnal,"TST, SOL, WASO",,,,standard,,first epoch of any sleep stage,,,,,,,1,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,n/a,,,morning questionnaire,generic,,,1,,,,,,,,3 nights,3,matched,1,,,n/a,direct question,question,,1,,,n/a,direct question,direct question,direct question,"sTST/oTST, sSOL/oSOL, sWASO/oWASO",1,rTST,rSOL,rWASO,,,,,,,0,,,1,,,ratio score,repeated measures ANOVA,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,n/a,one-sample t test/wilcoxon signed rank of ratio scores,n/a,,,,,

Once-daily sleep and self-rated symptom diaries were also collected via a smartphone app. Adherence with the devices and smartphone app, end-of-study user experiences, and agreement between subjective and objective sleep measures were analyzed. Thresholds for acceptability were set at a wear time or diary response rate of 70% or greater., RESULTS: Overall, 14 out of 15 participants completed the study. In individuals with a mild to moderate symptom severity at baseline (mean total Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale score 58.4 [SD 14.4]), we demonstrated high rates of engagement with the wearable device (all participants meeting acceptability criteria), sleep diary, and symptom diary (93% and 86% meeting criteria, respectively), with negative symptoms being associated with lower diary completion rate. The end-of-study usability and acceptability questionnaire and qualitative analysis identified facilitators and barriers to long-term use, and paranoia with study devices was not a significant barrier to engagement. Comparison between sleep diary and wearable estimated sleep times showed good correspondence (rho=0.50, P<.001)., CONCLUSIONS: Extended use of wearable and mobile technologies are acceptable to people with schizophrenia living in a community setting. In the future, these technologies may allow predictive, objective markers of clinical status, including early markers of impending relapse.

The method is compared to a conventional baseline technique in terms of sleep/wake stages detection accuracy in a dataset containing 55 recordings of actigraphy and PSG (acquired from 28 subjects). In addition, we explored how well the outputs of the new method agree with data acquired via sleep diaries in another dataset including 150 recordings (22 subjects). With 97% sensitivity and 73%specificity, the new method significantly outperformed the baseline one in modelling the PSG ground truth.

We assessed changes in discrepancies between subjective and objective sleep measures and correlations between discrepancy changes and clinical insomnia severity for CBT-I in patients with primary insomnia Methods: Fifty-two outpatients (mean age, 60.3 years; 26 women) with primary insomnia were treated by individual CBT-I (50 min, maximum six sessions, once every 1â€“2 weeks). One week before and after CBT-I, patients recorded a sleep log and wore an actigraphy device. Subjective and objective time in bed (TIB), total sleep time (TST), sleep-onset latency (SOL), wake time after sleep onset (WASO), and sleep efficiency (SE) were evaluated by averaging 1-week records. Relative values of sleep discrepancy in TIB, TST, SOL, WASO, and SE were calculated for estimating effects of CBT-I. The therapeutic effects were also evaluated using psychological scales before and after CBT-I. Results: Subjective and objective discrepancies in sleep measures decreased by 36, 25, and 37 min in TST, SOL, and WASO, respectively, and 7% in SE (all P < 0.001) after CBT-I. Seven patients transitioned from underestimating SE before CBT-I to overestimating SE after CBT-I. Although CBT-I improved relative values of discrepancy in WASO and SE, alongside ISI, the improvement in insomnia severity only correlated with SOL discrepancy. Conclusions: CBT-I may reduce the discrepancy between subjective and objective sleep measures in patients with primary insomnia. However, a greater therapeutic effect of CBT-I was observed in reducing the ISI, which was slightly influenced by improvements in sleep discrepancies.","research; tables/charts.

Most studies of sleep misperception examine sleep underestimation by comparing the results of polysomnography conducted in a laboratory environment with patients' sleep diary entries. We aimed to investigate psychosocial characteristics of adults who underestimated or overestimated sleep time in a nonclinical, middle-aged community-dwelling population. We collected one week of sleep data with wrist-worn accelerometers. We used egocentric social network analysis to analyze the effects of psychosocial factors. Among 4,060 study participants, 922 completed the accelerometer substudy. Underestimation was defined as an accelerometer-measured sleep time >= 6 h and a subjective sleep time < 6 h. Overestimation was defined as an objective sleep time < 6 h and a subjective sleep time >= 6 h. Psychosocial characteristics of the sleep misperception group were evaluated using multivariate regression analysis. A total of 47 participants underestimated sleep time, and 420 overestimated sleep time. Regression analysis revealed that women, living with spouse, economic satisfaction, and bridging potential had protective effects against sleep underestimation. Blame from a spouse involved a 3.8-times higher risk of underestimation than the control group (p = 0.002). In men, discussing concerns with a spouse had a protective effect against underestimation (p < 0.001). Economic satisfaction, feeling social network-based intimacy, and support from a spouse were associated with overestimation in women. In men, feeling social network-based intimacy was also associated with overestimation (p < 0.001). We found that social relationship quality was related to sleep overestimation and underestimation. This association was marked in women. Good social relationships may have positive effects on sleep misperception via attenuation of negative emotional reactions and effects on emotional regulation.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,Female;Humans;*Independent Living/px [Psychology];Male;Middle Aged;Perception;*Sleep/ph [Physiology];Time Factors;Psychology,,,,Psychosocial factors affecting sleep misperception in middle-aged community-dwelling adults,"Park et al., 2020",Korea,,,,1,,,,,,middle-aged adults,middle-aged adults,adults,,,normative,,,n/a,n/a,922,Actigraphy,,,1,1,,,,GENEActive Actigraph,,,Sadeh,,,,Algorithm found through provided reference--Sadeh used for GENEactiv in Rosenberger et al. 2016,not reported,not reported,not reported,,,,,,,,,n/a,n/a,,binary TST (cut-off at 6 hours),,,,,,n/a,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,binary TST (cut-off at 6 hours),n/a,,habitual sleep questionnaire (1 year),generic,,,,,,1,,,,,7 nights,7,habitual,,,,n/a,not reported,,,,,,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,binary cutoff (four groups--6 hours),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,forming of groups (?),mean values,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,n/a,n/a,n/a,,,,,

E-mail: luciano.drager@incor.usp.br","Purpose: This study was aimed to determine the magnitude and predictors of self-reported short/long sleep duration (SDUR) reclassifications using objective measurements. Method(s): Adult participants from the ELSA-Brasil study performed self-reported SDUR, 7-day wrist actigraphy, and a portable sleep study. We explored two strategies of defining self-reported SDUR reclassification: (1) short and long SDUR defined by <6 and >=8h, respectively; (2) reclassification using a large spectrum of SDUR categories (<5, 5-6, 7-8, 8-9, and >9 h). Result(s): Data from 2036 participants were used in the final analysis (43% males; age: 49+/-8 years). Self-reported SDUR were poorly correlated (r=0.263) and presented a low agreement with actigraphy-based total sleep time. 58% of participants who self-reported short SDUR were reclassified into the reference (6-7.99 h) or long SDUR groups using actigraphy data. 88% of participants that self-reported long SDUR were reclassified into the reference and short SDUR. The variables independently associated with higher likelihood of self-reported short SDUR reclassification included insomnia (3.5-fold), female (2.5-fold), higher sleep efficiency (1.35-fold), lowest O2 saturation (1.07-fold), higher wake after sleep onset (1.08-fold), and the higher number of awakening (1.05-fold). The presence of hypertension was associated with a 3.4-fold higher chance of self-reported long SDUR reclassification. Analysis of five self-reported SDUR categories revealed that the more extreme is the SDUR, the greater the self-reported SDUR reclassification. Conclusion(s): In adults, we observed a significant rate of short/long SDUR reclassifications when comparing self-reported with objective data. These results underscore the need to reappraise subjective data use for future investigations addressing SDUR.Copyright Â© 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,*actimetry;adult;arousal;article;*Brazil;controlled study;female;human;hypertension;insomnia;major clinical study;male;*measurement error;middle aged;oxygen saturation;sleep deprivation;sleep efficiency;*wake after sleep onset;wrist,,,santos_2022,Self-reported versus actigraphy-assessed sleep duration in the ELSA-Brasil study: analysis of the short/long sleep duration reclassification,"Santos et al., 2021",Brazil,,,1,,,,,,,participants in a longitudinal study,adults,adults,,,normative,,,n/a,n/a,2036,Actigraphy,,,1,1,,,,Actiwatch 2,,,not reported,,,1,algorithm info can't be found within study or related paper that was noted to include the same methodology.

Some studies suggested that it is a less deep and restorative sleep, but others did not support this interpretation. The present study was carried out to collect ample data on neurophysiology and subjective experience of sleep and on daytime cognitive performance to clarify this point. A sample of 128 primary insomniacs was investigated with polysomnography (PSG) that was submitted to a computerized, automatic analysis of alpha activity during sleep. It yielded two groups of 64 Ss each with a normal, that is, nonalpha sleep EEG and with alpha-sleep, respectively. Contrasting the two groups for PSG showed that alpha sleep Ss had significantly more stage 4 and a (nonsignificant) tendency for more awakenings. Subjectively, they largely underestimated intermittent wake time and consequently overestimated sleep duration by 50 min. The performance test battery showed a difference in one test only, that is, a better short-term memory function by alpha sleep Ss. In conclusion, there was no result supporting the assumption that alpha sleep is less restorative, but a significant lack of perception of intermittent awakenings during night sleep by alpha sleep Ss was found. The authors propose an explanation and point to the implications this misperception might have for the clinician.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,adult;alpha rhythm;article;*cognition;*electroencephalography;female;human;*insomnia;major clinical study;male;priority journal;short term memory;*sleep;*task performance;*wakefulness,,,schneider-helmert_1995,"Sleep, its subjective perception and daytime performance in insomniacs with a pattern of alpha sleep","Schneider-Helmert & Kumar, 1995",Switzerland,,,,1,,,,,,participants with primary insomnia,insomnia,adults,,,insomnia,,,n/a,n/a,128,PSG,1,1,,,,,,n/a,,,,,,,,n/a,n/a,n/a,,,,,,,,,R&K,in-lab,nocturnal,"TST, SOL, intermittent wake time (not defined)",,,,standard,,first 10 consecutive epochs Stage 2,,,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,n/a,,,Visual Analogue Scale (100mm),generic,,,,1,,,,,,,1 night,1,matched,1,,,n/a,visual,visual,,,,1,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"sTST-oTST, sSOL-oSOL, sIWT-oIWT",1,dTST,dSOL,dIWT,,,,,,,0,1,,,,,algebraic difference score,single night,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,n/a,n/a,n/a,,,,,

Studies of people with insomnia, in whom both sleep disturbances and discrepancy are common, suggest disturbances and discrepancy reflect differences in the sleeping brain's activity measurable using spectral electroencephalogram (EEG). Disentangling effects of discrepancy and disturbance on sleep EEG could help target research on the consequences and treatments of different sleep phenotypes. We therefore categorized participants in a cohort study including 2,850 men (average age = 76 years, standard deviation = 5.5) into four groups using median splits on actigraphic and self-reported sleep efficiency (SE). We compared spectral power between these groups in 1-Hz bins up to 24 Hz. Compared with the concordant-high SE group: (a) the group with high actigraphic and low self-reported SE had higher spectral power from 11-15 Hz across the night; (b) both groups with low actigraphic SE had higher power across the 15-24 Hz range, predominantly in early cycles, and greater slow frequency power in later cycles. These findings suggest that perceived wakefulness undetected by actigraphy may result from or drive activity corresponding to spindles. We also found, consistent with hyperarousal models, that low SE detectable via actigraphy was related to higher frequency power in the beta range; actigraph-measured inefficiency was also associated with later slow oscillations, potentially representing attempts to dissipate homeostatic drive elevated from earlier hyperarousal. These distinct spectral EEG markers (of low SE measured with actigraphy vs. low perceived SE that is not captured by actigraphy) may have different causes or consequences.Copyright Â© 2020 European Sleep Research Society","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,*actimetry;aged;article;cohort analysis;*electroencephalogram;*geriatric patient;human;major clinical study;male;nonREM sleep;phenotype;Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index;priority journal;REM sleep;self report;*sleep disorder;*sleep efficiency;sleep quality;sleep spindle;sleep time;*spectroscopy;wakefulness;actigraph,,,smagula_2021,"Spectral sleep electroencephalographic correlates of sleep efficiency, and discrepancies between actigraphy and self-reported measures, in older men","Smagula et al., 2021",USA,,,,,,,,,,males,men,adults,,men,normative,,,n/a,n/a,2850,Actigraphy,,,1,1,,,,SleepWatch-O,,,Cole-Kripke,UCSD,,,,Action W-2 software,Action W2,sleep diary --> manual scoring,,1,,1,,,,,n/a,n/a,,"SE split at median [PSG, PSQI]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,n/a,,,PSQI,Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI),,,,,1,,,,,,5 nights,5,habitual,,1,,TST/TIB * 100,direct question,question,,1,,,LO-RT,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,0,,,,,,,,,,n/a,,,,,,n/a,mean values,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,n/a,n/a,four groups based on binary split of SE subjective and objective,,,,,

Previous studies suggested that night-to-night variability could be an important feature differentiating subtypes of misperception. This study aimed for a data-driven definition of misperception subtypes revealed by multiple sleep features including night-to-night variability. We assessed features describing the mean and dispersion of misperception and objective and subjective sleep duration from 7-night diary and actigraphy recordings of 181 people with Insomnia Disorder and 55 people without sleep complaints. A minimally collinear subset of features was submitted to latent class analysis for data-driven subtyping. Analysis revealed three subtypes, best discriminated by three of five selected features: an individual's shortest reported subjective sleep duration; and the mean and standard deviation of misperception. These features were on average 5.4, -0.0 and 0.5 hr in one subtype accommodating the majority of good sleepers; 4.1, -1.4 and 1.0 hr in a second subtype representing the majority of people with Insomnia Disorder; and 1.7, -2.2 and 1.5 hr in a third subtype representing a quarter of people with Insomnia Disorder and hardly any good sleepers. Subtypes did not differ on an individual's objective sleep duration mean (6.9, 7.2 and 6.9 hr) and standard deviation (0.8, 0.8 and 0.9 hr). Data-driven analysis of naturalistic sleep revealed three subtypes that markedly differed in misperception features. Future studies may include misperception subtype to investigate whether it contributes to the unexplained considerable individual variability in treatment response.Copyright Â© 2019 The Authors.

E-mail: steven.m.thurman3.civ@mail.mil","There is extensive laboratory research studying the effects of acute sleep deprivation on biological and cognitive functions, yet much less is known about naturalistic patterns of sleep loss and the potential impact on daily or weekly functioning of an individual. Longitudinal studies are needed to advance our understanding of relationships between naturalistic sleep and fluctuations in human health and performance, but it is first necessary to understand the efficacy of current tools for long-term sleep monitoring. The present study used wrist actigraphy and sleep log diaries to obtain daily measurements of sleep from 30 healthy adults for up to 16 consecutive weeks. We used non-parametric Bland-Altman analysis and correlation coefficients to calculate agreement between subjectively and objectively measured variables including sleep onset time, sleep offset time, sleep onset latency, number of awakenings, the amount of wake time after sleep onset, and total sleep time. We also examined compliance data on the submission of daily sleep logs according to the experimental protocol. Overall, we found strong agreement for sleep onset and sleep offset times, but relatively poor agreement for variables related to wakefulness including sleep onset latency, awakenings, and wake after sleep onset. Compliance tended to decrease significantly over time according to a linear function, but there were substantial individual differences in overall compliance rates. There were also individual differences in agreement that could be explained, in part, by differences in compliance. Individuals who were consistently more compliant over time also tended to show the best agreement and lower scores on behavioral avoidance scale (BIS). Our results provide evidence for convergent validity in measuring sleep onset and sleep offset with wrist actigraphy and sleep logs, and we conclude by proposing an analysis method to mitigate the impact of non-compliance and measurement errors when the two methods provide discrepant estimates.Copyright This is an open access article, free of all copyright, and may be freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, modified, built upon, or otherwise used by anyone for any lawful purpose.

We evaluated physical activity and sleep-related measures and discussed the potential application of such devices for large-scale step and sleep data acquisition. To that end, we conducted two separate studies. In Study 1, we evaluated the performance of MB by comparing it to the GT3X (ActiGraph, wGT3X-BT), a scientific actigraph used in research, as well as subjective sleep reports. In Study 2, we distributed the MB across four countries (Austria, Germany, Cuba, and Ukraine) and investigated physical activity and sleep among these countries. The results of Study 1 indicated that MB step counts correlated highly with the scientific GT3X device, but did display biases. In addition, the MB-derived wake-up and total-sleep-times showed high agreement with subjective reports, but partly deviated from GT3X predictions. Study 2 revealed similar MB step counts across countries, but significant later wake-up and bedtimes for Ukraine than the other countries.

It characterizes a night's sleep or a person's sleep pattern, and is associated with numerous health outcomes. In most large studies, sleep duration is assessed with questionnaires or sleep diaries. As an alternative, actigraphy may be used, as it objectively measures sleep parameters and is feasible in large studies. However, actigraphy and sleep diaries may not measure exactly the same phenomenon. Our study aims to determine disagreement between actigraphic and diary estimates of sleep duration, and to investigate possible determinants of this disagreement. This investigation was embedded in the population-based Rotterdam Study. The study population consisted of 969 community-dwelling participants aged 57-97 years. Participants wore an actigraph and kept a sleep diary for, on average, six consecutive nights. Both measures were used to determine total sleep time (TST). In 34% of the participants, the estimated TST in the sleep diaries deviated more than 1 h from actigraphically measured TST. The level of disagreement between diary and actigraphic measures decreased with subjective and actigraphic measures of sleep quality, and increased with male gender, poor cognitive function and functional disability. Actigraphically measured poor sleep was often accompanied by longer subjective estimates of TST, whereas subjectively poor sleepers tended to report shorter TST in their diaries than was measured with actigraphy. We recommend, whenever possible, to use multiple measures of sleep duration, to perform analyses with both, and to examine the consistency of the results over assessment methods.","1365-2869     Van Den Berg, Julia F     Van Rooij, Frank J A     Vos, Henk     Tulen, Joke H M     Hofman, Albert     Miedema, Henk M E     Neven, Arie Knuistingh     Tiemeier, Henning     Comparative Study     Journal Article     Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't     England     2008/03/07     J Sleep Res. 2008 Sep;17(3):295-302. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2869.2008.00638.x.

We hypothesized that the PSQI and its factor structure would be valid in premenopausal women. Material(s) and Method(s): We performed a validation study of the PSQI against wrist actigraphy in a community-based convenience sample of 71 healthy premenopausal women (aged 40-50 years). For convergent validity, PSQI and its component scores were compared with homologous actigraphy measures. For discriminant validity, characteristics known to affect sleep quality were compared, including body mass index, exercise, menopausal status, menopausal symptoms, and depressive symptoms measured with the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression (CES-D) Scale. Result(s): The PSQI global score and Components 1 (quality) and 5 (disturbance) were correlated (p<0.05) with actigraphy-measured wake after sleep onset. The PSQI global score and Components 1 (quality) and 7 (daytime dysfunction) were correlated with CES-D scores. PSQI Components 2 (onset latency) and 4 (efficiency) were not congruent with homologous actigraphy measures, while component 3 (duration) was congruent with actigraphy duration. The single-factor PSQI global score had a higher McDonald's omega (0.705) and Cronbach's alpha (0.702) than the two-factor or three-factor models. Conclusion(s): The PSQI global score is a valid measure of sleep quality in healthy midlife women, performing better than two-factor or three-factor models.

Objective measures were assessed via 7-days/nights of actigraphy data to determine average and intra-individual variability of several sleep measures (including time spent in bed and onset latency). Spearman's correlation coefficient and Cohen's Îº were used to assess the agreement between self-reported and actigraphy-assessed measures. Associations between insomnia and actigraphy-assessed sleep parameters were evaluated using partial least-square discriminant analysis (PLS-DA).Results: We found fair correlation between self-reported and actigraphy-assessed time spent in bed in 342 PWH (rsâ€Š=â€Š0.46) and 119 HIV-negative individuals (rsâ€Š=â€Š0.48). Among PWH, the correlation did not differ by age, education, depressive symptoms and self-reported insomnia (all Pâ€Š>â€Š0.05), but was stronger in men (Pâ€Š=â€Š0.05) and in those with a BMI of at least 25â€Škg/m2 (Pâ€Š<â€Š0.001). Agreement between self-reported and actigraphy-assessed sleep onset latency was poor in both PWH (Îºâ€Š=â€Š0.002, Pâ€Š=â€Š0.49) and HIV-negative individuals (Îºâ€Š=â€Š0.009, Pâ€Š=â€Š0.65). According to PLS-DA, self-reported insomnia most strongly correlated with intra-individual variability of sleep duration, movement index and efficiency.Conclusion: We report poor-to-fair agreement between self-reported and actigraphy-assessed sleep measures in PWH. Insomnia symptoms correlated with regularity of sleep duration, quality and efficiency. These findings highlight the importance of both patient-reported and objective measures of daily sleep variation, for better understanding sleep disorders in PWH.","research.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the relationship between subjective sleep habits estimation and objective measurement data in schoolchildren. METHOD(S): The study consisted of 42 healthy junior high school children aged 13-14. Sleep log information was gathered over 7 consecutive days, using a sleep-monitoring device (Actiwatch) and a questionnaire which covered the following aspects for sleep quality and quantity: bed time, sleep latency, sleep start, sleep end, wake up and assumed sleep length. The means of the sleep indices for 5 weekdays were used for analysis. Pearson's correlation coefficients and paired t-tests were used to evaluate the correlation and difference between subjective and objective sleep parameters. RESULT(S): The correlation coefficient between subjective and objective records was 0.49 (p < 0.001) for sleep latency, 0.99 (p < 0.001) for sleep start time, 0.99 (p < 0.001) for sleep end time, and 0.97 (p < 0.001) for assumed sleep length. The difference between subjective and objective records was 7.67 min (95% confidence interval [CI]: 4.64-10.71) for sleep latency, and 0:02 min (95% CI: -0:01-0:05) for sleep start time, 0:02 min (95% CI: 0:01-0:03) for sleep end time, and 8.19 min (95% CI: 4.93-11.45) for assumed sleep length. CONCLUSION(S): Although children tended to overestimate sleeping hours, the correlation between subjective and objective sleep indices except sleep latency was quite high. Thus, children's sleep questionnaire can be applied to surveys for sleep habits screening.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,adolescent;article;human;*information processing;Japan;male;physiology;*questionnaire;*sleep;validation study;Questionnaires;Child;Only Child,,,gaina_2004,Validity of child sleep diary questionnaire among junior high school children,"Gaina et al., 2004",Japan,,,1,,,,,,,healthy junior high school children,adolescents,adolescents,,,normative,,,n/a,n/a,42,Actigraphy,,,1,1,,,,Actiwatch,,,not reported,,,,,not reported,not reported,sleep diary,,1,,,,,,,n/a,n/a,,"TST, SOL (6 options), sleep onset, sleep offset",,,,standard,,actigraphy-defined,,,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,n/a,,,sleep diary,generic,1,,,,,,,,,,5 nights,5,matched,1,,,n/a,direct question,question,,1,,,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,0,,,,,,,,,,n/a,,,,,,n/a,mean values,,1,,,,,,,,1,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,n/a,"pearson correlations, paired t test",n/a,,,,,

Objective: To compare self-reported sleep and actigraphy in this age group, by studying gender differences and, using a new graphical approach, the survival agreement plot. Methods: Thirty-seven subjects, aged 12 to 17 years, answered questions about nocturnal sleep duration and used actigraphy for seven days. The mean and median differences between the informed sleep and the recorded one, the intraclass correlation coefficient, the Bland-Altman plot and the survival-agreement plot were used. Results: A mean difference of about one hour (SD = 2.1; median = 0.5; p < 0.01) was found between both strategies, which was higher among boys, 1.9 hours (SD = 2.8; median = 1.6; p < 0.05), than among girls, 0.5 hours (SD = 1.4; median = 0.3; p = 0.11). The graphical evaluation showed similar results, as well as the intraclass correlation coefficient: 0.06 (95%CI = -0.33 â€“ 0.46; p = 0.489) for boys and 0.43 (95%CI = 0.12 â€“ 0.83; p < 0.001) for girls. Conclusions: Our data are consistent with previous studies as to non-agreement between the two methods. These results are relevant because this is the first study of concordance between subjective measures of sleep and actigraphy among Brazilian adolescents, as far as we know. In addition, they reinforce the need of a careful use of nocturnal sleep measures among adolescents, mainly among boys. Â© 2016, Assocaicao Brasileira de Pos, Gradacao em Saude Coletiva.

However, the ability to accurately recall sleep practices during pregnancy has been questioned. The aim of this study is to test the accuracy of recall of normal sleep practices in late pregnancy. METHODS: Thirty healthy women between 35 and 38Â weeks of gestation underwent level III respiratory polysomnography (PSG) with infrared digital video recordings in their own homes. Data regarding sleep positions, number of times getting out of bed during the night and respiratory measures were collected. A sleep questionnaire was administered the morning after the recorded sleep. Continuous data were assessed using Spearman's Rho and Bland-Altman. Cohen's Kappa was used to assess recall in the categorical variables. RESULTS: Two-thirds of participants went to sleep on their left side. There was good agreement in sleep onset position between video and questionnaire data (Kappa 0.52), however the there was poor agreement on position on wakening (Kappa 0.24). The number of times getting out of bed during the night was accurately recalled (Kappa 0.65). Twenty five out of 30 participants snored as recorded by PSG. Questionnaire data was inaccurate for this measure. Bland-Altman plots demonstrated acceptable agreement between video and questionnaire data for estimated sleep duration, but not the time taken to fall asleep (sleep latency). One participant had mild obstructive sleep apnoea and another probable high upper airways resistance. CONCLUSIONS: Sleep onset position, sleep duration and the number of times getting out of bed during the night were accurately recalled, but sleep latency and sleep position on waking were not. This study identifies the sleep variables that can be accurately obtained by questionnaire and those that cannot.","1471-2393     McIntyre, Jordan P R     Ingham, Cayley M     Hutchinson, B Lynne     Thompson, John M D     McCowan, Lesley M     Stone, Peter R     Veale, Andrew G     Cronin, Robin     Stewart, Alistair W     Ellyett, Kevin M     Mitchell, Edwin A     Journal Article     Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't     2016/05/20     BMC Pregnancy Childbirth. 2016 May 18;16(1):115. doi: 10.1186/s12884-016-0905-0. | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,"Adult;*Diagnostic Self Evaluation;Female;Healthy Volunteers;Humans;Polysomnography;Pregnancy;Pregnancy Complications/*diagnosis/psychology;Pregnancy Trimester, Third/physiology/*psychology;Self Report/*standards;Sleep/*physiology;Sleep Wake Disorders/*diagnosis/psychology;Surveys and Questionnaires;Young Adult;*Polysomnography;*Pregnancy;*Questionnaire;*Self-report;*Sleep study",,,mcintyre_2016,"A description of sleep behaviour in healthy late pregnancy, and the accuracy of self-reports","McIntyre et al., 2016",New Zealand,,,1,,,,,,,healthy women late in third trimester,pregnancy,adults,,women,pregnancy,,,n/a,n/a,30,Level III respiratory PSG w/ video,,,,,Level III respiratory PSG with video,,,n/a,,,,,,,,n/a,n/a,n/a,,,,,,,,,n/a,home-based,,"TST, SOL, times to toilet, position at sleep onset, position at wake, number positional changes, presence of leg twitches/jerks",,,,standard,,video observation,,,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"position at sleep onset, position at wake, number positional changes, presence of leg twitches/jerks",sleep behaviours,,Morning questionnaire,generic,,,1,,,,,,,,1 night,1,matched,1,,,n/a,direct question,question,,1,,,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,0,,,,,,,,,,n/a,,,,,,n/a,single night,,,1,,,,,,,1,1,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,n/a,"spearman correlations, bland altman, Cohens kappa",n/a,,,,,

To elucidate the mechanisms underlying this tendency, we examined the role of pre-sleep cognitive arousal and overgeneralization.Methods: We monitored the sleep of 54 community dwellers (the majority being university students), using actigraphy and a sleep diary for 7 days. Immediately after this period, the participants provided an additional global evaluation of their sleep for the past week. In this global evaluation, participants were asked to estimate their average number of hours of sleep and the duration of time taken to fall asleep (sleep onset latency) across the past seven nights.Results: Single-night misperceptions (difference between actigraphy and sleep diary estimations) of sleep time and sleep onset latency were significantly associated with pre-sleep cognitive arousal, but not with overgeneralization. In contrast, global misperception of sleep (difference between sleep diary and global estimations) were associated with overgeneralization, but not with cognitive arousal.Limitations: Our sample mainly consisted of female university students, which limits the generalizability of the results.Conclusions: Misperception of sleep occurs in two cases: (1) in the case of a single night due to excessive arousal, and (2) in the case of multiple nights due to overgeneralization.","research.

In Experiment 1, 30 good and 30 poor sleepers were instructed either to monitor or not to monitor a clock as they were trying to get to sleep. Worry was indexed by self-rating. Sleep was measured by self-report and actigraphy. Compared to non-monitors, clock-monitors reported more pre-sleep worry and they experienced longer sleep onset latency (SOL). These findings held true for both good and poor sleepers. In Experiment 2, following one night of baseline measurement, 38 individuals diagnosed with primary insomnia were instructed to monitor either a clock or a digit display unit (a control monitoring task) as they were trying to get to sleep. The clock-monitoring task was rated to be more worry provoking and sleep interfering than the display unit-monitoring task. Whilst display unit-monitors experienced less pre-sleep worry, the clock-monitors experienced more pre-sleep worry and reported a longer SOL on the experimental night, relative to baseline. Further, compared to the display unit-monitors, the clock-monitors overestimated their SOL more on the experimental night. Together, these findings suggest that clock monitoring may trigger pre-sleep worry and serve to maintain insomnia by fuelling pre-sleep worry and exacerbating misperception of sleep.","Tang, Nicole K Y     Anne Schmidt, D     Harvey, Allison G     065913/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom     Journal Article     Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't     Netherlands     2006/06/24     J Behav Ther Exp Psychiatry. 2007 Mar;38(1):40-55. doi: 10.1016/j.jbtep.2005.07.004.

Further, the patients regarded the behavioral experiment as a more beneficial and acceptable intervention strategy than verbal feedback.","Tang, Nicole K Y     Harvey, Allison G     065913/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom     Journal Article     Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't     United States     2006/08/03     J Consult Clin Psychol. 2006 Aug;74(4):767-76. doi: 10.1037/0022-006X.74.4.767. | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,Adolescent;Adult;Anxiety/diagnosis/psychology;*Attitude;*Feedback;Female;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Polysomnography;Severity of Illness Index;*Sleep;Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders/diagnosis/*psychology/*therapy;Surveys and Questionnaires;*Verbal Behavior;Feedback;Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders,,,tangharvey_2006,Altering misperception of sleep in insomnia: behavioral experiment versus verbal feedback,"Tang & Harvey, 2006",Various,,,,1,,,1,,,individuals with primary insomnia,insomnia,adults,,,insomnia,,,24 behavioural experiment,24 verbal feedback,48,Actigraphy ,,,1,1,,,,Mini Motionlogger Basic,,,Cole-Kripke,,,,,Action W,Action W,"Webster's rules (daily sleep logs, notes, illumination channel)",,1,1,,,,,,n/a,n/a,,"TST, SOL",,,,standard,,actigraphy-defined,,,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,n/a,,,sleep diary,generic,1,,,,,,,,,,"2 nights (baseline), 2 nights (post experimental condition)",4,matched,1,,,n/a,direct question,question,,1,,,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"sTST-oTST, sSOL-oSOL",1,dTST,dSOL,,,,,,,,0,1,,,,,algebraic difference score,mean values,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,n/a,n/a,n/a,,,,,

As more attention is being paid to the sleep problems of HF patients, it is important to evaluate the degree of congruence between subjective and objective sleep measurements in this patient group. Purpose: This study was developed to evaluate the congruence between sleep parameters as measured using a wrist-worn ActiGraph and a daily sleep log in patients with stable HF. Methods: Forty-three HF patients aged 40-92 years served as subjects. Sleep parameters were derived from actigraphy and a daily sleep log by averaging scores for 7 nights. Results: There were significant differences in wake time after sleep onset (WASO) and total sleep time between the sleep log and the ActiGraph (both ps < .001). Neither WASO nor sleep onset latency, both derived from the sleep log, correlated significantly with actigraphy variables. The mean bias for WASO and total sleep time between methods was 54.1 min (SD = 47.5 min) and 109.3 min (SD = 91.68 min) as assessed using a Bland-Altman analysis. A majority (83.7%) of participants experienced sleep disturbances as assessed by actigraphy. However, fewer (53.5%) had sleep disturbances as assessed using the sleep log. Conclusion: A considerable degree of incongruence between actigraphy- and sleep log-derived measures of sleep exists in patients with stable HF.","research; tables/charts.

But new technologies have been developed, providing us with objective alternatives to measure sleep in free-living conditions. The goal of this study is to compare subjective and objective sleep assessments in a population of failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS) patients, treated with spinal cord stimulation (SCS). Method(s): 22 patients diagnosed with FBSS received SCS. Sleep data was collected one month before SCS implantation (B), after one month (T1) and after two months of SCS (T2). Objective data collection was performed by actigraphy, while subjective data was collected using the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI). Agreement between sleep parameters, total sleep time (TST), sleep efficiency (SE) and sleep onset latency (SOL), was examined. Result(s): A paired t-test revealed significant differences for TST and SE at baseline and after two months of SCS, while patients underestimate both parameters on the PSQI in comparison to objective measurements. For SOL no significant differences were found, although patients subjectively overestimate SOL at B. Conclusion(s): In general, our results show that sleep is subjectively rated worse than objectively measured. Secondly, short-term SCS seems to affect the subjectively measured sleep parameters more, especially SOL. This study shows the discrepancies between objective and subjective assessments in chronic pain research. Objective tools are invaluable for a correct assessment and treatment, additionally also playing a role as a biofeedback tool, supporting the rehabilitation process.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,actimetry;adult;biofeedback;chronic pain;clinical article;conference abstract;controlled study;failed back surgery syndrome;female;human;implantation;male;Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index;rehabilitation;sleep latency;*sleep quality;sleep time;*spinal cord stimulation;Spinal Cord,,,dejaeger_2019,Does spinal cord stimulation really influences sleep?,"De Jaeger et al., 2019",Belgium,,,1,,,,,,,"patients diagnosed with failed back surgery syndrome, treated with spinal cord stimulation",failed back surgery syndrome,adults,,,failed back surgery syndrome,,,n/a,n/a,19,Actigraphy,,,1,1,,,,Actiwatch Spectrum Plus,,,Actiware (not reported),,,,,Actiware 6.0.9,Actiware,n/a or not reported,,,,,,,1,,n/a,n/a,,"TST, SOL, SE",,,,standard,,actigraphy-defined,,,,TST/TIB*100,,,1,1,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,n/a,,,PSQI,Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI),,,,,1,,,,,,"3*14 nights (baseline, T1, T2)",42,matched,1,,,TST/TIB*100,direct question,question,,1,,,LO-RT,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,0,,,,,,,,,,n/a,,,,,,n/a,"pooled for bland altman, unknown for t-tests",,,,,,,,1,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,n/a,"bland altman, paired t test",n/a,,,,,

Methods A cross-sectional study was undertaken from December 2019 to January 2021. Total sleep time was objectively assessed from the overnight PSG and subjectively estimated. The sleep perception index (SPI) was defined by the ratio of subjective and objective values. Diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) was based on an apnea-hypopnea index >= 5.0/h. Insomnia was defined by the presence of one or more specific complaints: difficulty falling asleep, difficulty maintaining sleep, and/or waking up earlier than desired. The association between continuous variables and SPI was assessed by linear regression analysis. Results This study enrolled 2,004 outpatients (56% men) who were grouped into four subsamples: controls (n = 139), insomnia (n = 154), OSA (n = 912), and insomnia comorbid with OSA [COMISA] (n = 799). In women, the median SPI differed among groups and ranged from 89 to 102% (p = 0.001); while in men, it ranged from 90% to 99% (p = 0.007). However, no gender-related SPI value differences emerged within each of the subgroups: controls (p = 0.907), insomnia (p = 0.830), OSA (p = 0.070), and COMISA (p = 0.547). The presence of insomnia (beta, - 0.101, p < 0.001) or OSA (beta, - 0.082, p = 0.001), but not gender (beta, - 0.017, p = 0.612), were independent predictors of the SPI.

Comparing to the literature on the association between two continuous or two binary outcomes, to our knowledge, fewer works were published for the case when one outcome is continuous and the other is binary while both are measured repeatedly. We address this problem by considering a latent correlation (LC) that is the correlation between two continuous outcomes. The first is the original observed continuous outcome while the second is an underlying latent variable, dichotomization of which produces the original binary outcome. Building upon a flexible Bayesian generalized linear mixed model fitted by the MCMC, our proposal allows estimation of the total correlation, and the between- and within-subject correlations simultaneously. The goal of joint estimation of all these correlations, to our knowledge, was not fulfilled in previous proposals (either the between- or within-subject correlation needed to be fixed at zero). Moreover, the approach avoids bias of a two-step procedure and does not rely on approximation of the covariance matrix and hence the correlations. It provides accurate estimates covering a wide range of values. We can also incorporate the cases of missing data, covariate adjustment, and comparison between subgroups. Furthermore, these advantages are achieved at a low computational cost. We demonstrate properties and implementation of our proposal with a large simulation study and with real data from two clinical trials of an insomnia drug where one of the questions is how continuous biomarkers derived from the polysomnographic measurements are associated with the binary patient-reported sleep quality.

We divided participants into a home stayers (HS) group (subject to full stay-at home orders) and an area-restricted workers (ARW) group (permitted to work at their nearby workplaces). The HS group demonstrated significantly delayed actigraphy-defined sleep onset time compared to self-reported sleep onset time; this effect was absent in the ARW group. Between-group differences in actigraphy-defined sleep onset time and significant between-group differences for actigraphy-defined and self-reported wake-up time were observed. HS group participants also presented significantly delayed actigraphy-defined wake-up time compared with selfreported wake-up time. No significant effect was found on total sleep time perception. Moreover, sleep/wake time misperception were found to be associated with daylight exposure and physical activity levels respectively. To the extent they are generalizable, these results suggest that lockdown restrictions can affect sleep onset and wake-up time perception but not total sleep time perception.

Herring, Department of Medicine, Center for Obesity Research and Education, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, United States","Introduction: Survey questions are commonly used to assess sleep duration because of their low-cost and convenience. Responses to these questions typically correlate moderately with objectively measured sleep durations in non-pregnant individuals, but little is known about the validity of self-reported sleep measures in pregnancy. As pregnancy is a time period associated with increased sleepiness and fatigue, women may be prone to misreport actual time spent sleeping. However, direction of bias and factors associated with bias are unknown. Method(s): We analyzed data from 87 mothers enrolled in Project MOMMIES, a longitudinal study of urban pregnant women. Sleep measurements were collected in mid-pregnancy (mean 21 weeks' gestation) and included 7-days of wrist actigraphy along with a standard survey question about usual sleep duration (""During the past month, how many hours of actual sleep did you get at night?""). Paired t-tests and linear regression assessed agreement between subjective and objective measures of nocturnal gestational sleep duration. Result(s): The majority of participants were Black (84%), high school graduates (67%), low-income (100% Medicaid), and < 25 years old (74%). Average measured nocturnal sleep duration was 6.9 hours (standard deviation [SD] 0.9), while subjective reports averaged 7.3 hours (SD 2.1; 0.4 hours longer than measured sleep). Mothers who slept < 6 hours per night were more likely to over-report average sleep time than those who slept 7 or more hours. Bias did not signiicantly vary by age, race, body mass index, parity, education, or sleepiness. Overall, there was a correlation of -0.01 (95% conidence interval -0.22, 0.20) between subjective and objective measures of sleep duration in pregnancy, indicating the ranking of individuals was not well preserved. Conclusion(s): Self-reports of usual sleep hours do not relect objectively measured sleep time in urban pregnant women. Actigraphy is preferable to accurately assess gestational sleep duration for this population.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,*sleep time;*human;*female;*sleep;*organization;*pregnant woman;*mother;pregnancy;somnolence;actimetry;night;linear regression analysis;Student t test;population;self report;education;parity;body mass;night sleep;medicaid;wrist;lowest income group;longitudinal study;high school graduate;fatigue;validity,,,herring_2013,Do pregnant women accurately report their sleep time?

Huang, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China","Introduction: Hyperarousal during both diurnal and nocturnal periods may be the central pathophysiological changes for patients with primary insomnia (PI). Compared to health control, PI normally have significantly lower amount of subjective sleep with respect to objective evaluated sleep, and also exhibit greater score of multiple sleep latency test (MSLT). The former suggests nocturnal sleep state misperception and the latter may reflect diurnal physiological arousal. The relationship of diurnal physiological arousal and nocturnal sleep state misperception has not been studied in PI patients. Method(s): The data for overnight polysomnography, morning questionnaire, four naps MSLT and Epworth Sleep Scale (ESS) were collected in PI patients (n=122, age 39.3+/-10.9) and health control (n=48, age 38.5+/-12.7). Sleep perception (SP) was calculated with subjective sleep time/objective sleep time *100%. Result(s): Compared to control, PI patients had significantly reductions in time spent in total sleep and slow wave sleep, in REM percentage and prolonged sleep latency, greater MSLT value and lower ESS score. The means of SP significantly differed (p<0.001) between PI patients (56.4+/-38.8%) and control (99.3+/-13.6%). Among individuals of PI, the values of SP was negatively correlated to MSLT score (r=-0.20, p<0.05) and positively associated to ESS score (r=0.28, p<0.01) and objective total sleep time (r=0.20, p<0.05). In PI patients, two-way ANOVA using age as a covariate revealed that MSLT score had significantly main effect on SP value, but objective sleep time did not. In control, both MSLT and objective sleep time did not have effect on SP value. Conclusion(s): Sleep state misperception with lower estimated subjective sleep amount relative to objective sleep and hyperarousal reflected with greater MSLT score were found in PI patients compared to health control.

METHOD(S): Patients were recruited from specialized ILD clinics. Total sleep time, sleep efficiency, sleep latency and number of sleep disturbances were measured using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and an ActiGraph monitor worn on patients' non-dominant wrist for seven consecutive days. Step counts were monitored over the same period using a waist monitor. Extrapulmonary symptoms were assessed with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and Brief Pain Inventory. Multivariable analyses were used to examine whether physical activity and extrapulmonary symptoms were determinants of sleep quality in fibrotic ILD. RESULT(S): A total of 111 patients were assessed (62% male, mean age 70 +/- 9 years). Mean self-reported total sleep time was 494 +/- 80mins/night. Median self-reported sleep efficiency and latency were 97% (94-98%) and 15 min (8-30 min), respectively. Poor sleep quality was reported in 61% of patients. Wrist monitors detected a mean total sleep time of 441 +/- 72mins/night. Median sleep efficiency and latency measured by wrist monitors were 88% (83-91%) and 2 min (0-7 min), respectively. The PSQI was largely within limits of agreement in reference to the wrist monitor recordings. Higher pain severity was an independent predictor of reduced sleep efficiency, increased sleep latency and greater number of sleep disturbances measured by the PSQI on adjusted analyses. CONCLUSION(S): The PSQI is generally in agreement with wrist actigraphy measurements. Pain is a determinant of sleep in fibrotic ILD.Copyright Â© 2020 Canadian Thoracic Society.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,*actigraph;aged;article;Brief Pain Inventory;clinical assessment;*comorbidity;female;*fibrosing alveolitis;Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale;human;limit of agreement;major clinical study;male;night;pain severity;physical activity;Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index;*self report;sleep disorder;sleep efficiency;sleep latency;*sleep quality;sleep time;step count;*wrist;Lung;Lung Diseases,,,hur_2022,Characterization and determinants of sleep measured by self-report and wrist actigraphy in patients with interstitial lung disease,"Hur et al., 2020",Canada,,,1,,,,,,,patients with interstitial lung disease,interstitial lung disease,adults,,,interstitial lung disease,,,n/a,n/a,111,Actigraphy,,,1,1,,,,ActiGraph wGT3X-BT,,,Cole-Kripke,,,,,ActiLife 6.13.3,ActiLife,sleep diaries,,1,,,,,,,n/a,n/a,,"TST, SOL, SE, number of sleep disturbances",,,,standard,,actigraphy-defined,,,,TST/TIB*100,,standard,1,1,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,n/a,,,PSQI,Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI),,,,,1,,,,,,7 nights,7,habitual,,1,,TST/TIB*100,direct question,question (weighted average),,1,,,LO-RT,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,0,,,,,,,,,,n/a,,,,,,n/a,not reported (likely mean values),1,,,,,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,n/a,"bland altman , pearson correlation",n/a,,,,,

Moreover, OSA and insomnia can also be comorbid. This study aims at finding the proportion of SSM and ""Comorbid Insomnia with OSA"" (COMISA) among patients of OSA and chronic insomnia. Macroachitecture of sleep was also compared across groups. Methods: This study utilized the retrospective laboratory and medical records of two groups of patients: chronic insomnia and OSA. Sleep disorders were diagnosed according to standard criteria. Daytime sleepiness was examined using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. Diagnosis of SSM was based on the difference between subjective and objective sleep onset latency (Subjective SOL > 1.5 x Objective SOL). Results: Sixteen adult subjects were included in each group. Based on the difference between subjective and objective sleep onset latency, SSM was reported by 62.5% subjects of chronic insomnia and 56.25% subjects having OSA (OR = 1.29; 95% CI = 0.31-5.33; P = 0.79). The proportion of COMISA in subjects with chronic insomnia was 18% and among subjects with OSA, it was 43%. Effect size for the proportion was calculated as odds ratio (33.96; 95% CI = 7.48-154.01; P < 0.0002). Thus, the odds for COMISA were higher among subjects with OSA than those with chronic Insomnia. The three groups (OSA, COMISA and Chronic Insomnia) were comparable with regard to the macro-architecture of sleep. Conclusion: SSM is common among subjects with OSA and chronic insomnia. COMISA was commoner among patients with OSA compared to those with chronic insomnia. Macro-architecture of sleep is comparable among groups.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,"Sleep Apnea Syndromes;Comorbidity;Sleep Apnea, Obstructive;Apnea;Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders",,,kundu_2022,Polysomnographic Characteristics of the Patients Having Chronic Insomnia and Obstructive Sleep Apnea: Evidence for Paradoxical Insomnia and Comorbid Insomnia with OSA (COMISA),"Kundu et al., ",India,,,,1,,,,,,individuals with chronic insomnia and obstructive sleep apnoea,sleep disorders; insomnia,adults,,,insomnia,sleep disorders,,"16 with chronic insomnia, 16 with obstructive sleep apnoea",,32,PSG,1,1,,,,,,n/a,,,,,,,,n/a,n/a,n/a,,,,,,,,,AASM,in-lab,nocturnal,SOL,,,,,,first epoch of any sleep stage,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,n/a,,,Morning interview,generic,,,,,,,,1,,,1 night,1,matched,1,,,n/a,n/a,,,,,,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,sSOL > 1.5 oSOL to binary,1,dSOL,,,,,,,,,binary,1,,,,,algebraic difference score to form categorical variable (binary),single night,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,n/a,n/a,n/a,,,,,

RESULTS: The STOP-BANG questionnaire was a good predictor for the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea. However, the other instruments did not show a significant difference between healthy and sick individuals. Patients' perceptions of their sleep onset time were significantly lower than the polysomnographic data, but this difference remained for both subjects with and without obstructive sleep apnea. No difference was found between the subjective duration of sleep and the total sleep time assessed by polysomnography in either the healthy subjects or the patients. CONCLUSION: Except for the STOP-BANG questionnaire, subjective evaluation of sleepiness, sleep quality, perception of onset, and total sleep time are not important parameters for the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea, which reinforces the need for an active search for better management of these patients.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,"Sleep Apnea Syndromes;Sleep Apnea, Obstructive;Sleep",,,laranjeira_2018,Is subjective sleep evaluation a good predictor for obstructive sleep apnea?,"Laranjeira et al., 2018",Brazil,,,1,1,,,,,,individuals referred to a sleep centre,individuals referred for PSG,adults,,,referred for PSG,,,n/a,n/a,248,PSG,1,1,,,,,,n/a,,,,,,,,n/a,n/a,n/a,,,,,,,,,AASM,in-lab,nocturnal,"TST, SOL",,,,standard,,first epoch of any sleep stage,,,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,n/a,,,Post-Sleep Data Collection Instrument (morning questionnaire),generic,,,,1,,,,,,,1 night,1,matched,1,,,n/a,direct question,question,,1,,,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,sTST/oTST*100,1,rTST100,,,,,,,,,0,,,1,,,"ratio score (OSE Edinger & Fins, 1995)",single night,,,1,,,,,,,1,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,n/a,"wilcoxon signed rank test, spearman correlation",n/a,,,,,

Methods:We retrospectively analyzed 355 patients diagnosed with OSAHS by PSG at the Sleep Medicine Center of Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University. Patients saw a doctor due to snoring and daytime sleepiness from March 2017 to March 2018. We excluded the patients who are <18 years old, had a history of OSAHS treatment, had other sleep and psychiatric disorders, and could not provide complete data. According to the patients' explanation, medical history, PSG indicators, and morning questionnaire after PSG, the patients were divided into normal sleep perception (NSP), positive sleep perception abnormality (PSPA), and negative sleep perception abnormality (NSPA). We analyze the demographic characteristics and PSG of the three groups with ANOVA and non-parametric tests. In addition, we conducted correlation analysis between sleep perception and PSG indicators. Results:Of OSAHS patient, 55.5% had sleep perception abnormalities, of which 35.5% were positive-perception abnormalities and 20% were negative-perception abnormalities. From the analysis of PSG indicators, the sleep perception abnormality was related to the frequency of spontaneous arousal of the patient (P= 0.003) and was not related to the slight arousal caused by respiratory events, oxygen desaturations, and limb movement events. OSAHS patients with PSPA had a higher oxygen desaturation index (P= 0.046) but no significant difference inpost hoctest. PSPA group had significantly lower rapid eye movement (REM) latency and sleep efficiency and more wake after sleep onset (WASO) than had the other sleep perception groups. Multivariate linear regression analyses after adjusting for age and sex revealed that sleep perception was related to lowest oxygen saturation (LSaO(2)), TS90%, sleep efficiency, and WASO. Conclusion:Sleep perception abnormality is common in OSAHS patients. OSAHS patients with different sleep perception types have different PSG profiles. The OSAHS patients with PSPA have more severe hypoxia levels at night that require timely personalized treatment.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,"Polysomnography;Sleep Apnea Syndromes;Sleep Apnea, Obstructive;Sleep",,,liu_analysis_2020,Analysis of Clinical Characteristics and Polysomnography Indicators of Obstructive Sleep Apnea-Hypopnea Syndrome Patients Based on Sleep Perception Types,"Liu et al., 2020",China,,,,1,,,,,,patients diagnosed with OSA,obstructive sleep apnoea,adults,,,obstructive sleep apnoea,,,n/a,n/a,355,PSG,1,1,,,,,,n/a,,,,,,,,n/a,n/a,n/a,,,,,,,,,AASM,in-lab,nocturnal,TST,,,,standard,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,n/a,,,morning questionnaire,generic,,,1,,,,,,,,1 night,1,matched,1,,,n/a,direct question,question,,1,,,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"sTST-oTST -> trichotomy categorical, sTST/oTST",1,dTST,rTST,,,,,,,,trichotomy,1,,1,,,"algebraic difference score to form categorical variable (trichotomy), ratio score",single night,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,n/a,n/a,n/a,,,,,

The study aimed to asses sleep/wake perception in electrophysiologically defined sleep in patients with sleep disorders. 117 consecutively referred patients (75 females), median age 50.3 years, range 20-73 years) with various sleep disorders were randomized for one induced waking, either out of stage 2 (S2) or REM sleep, as part of a clinical routine polysomnography. Patients were classified as either non-sleepy (Epworth Sleepiness Scale score ESS <= 10) or sleepy (ESS >= 11). The most frequent diagnoses of non-sleepy patients were insomnia and RLS, while sleepy patients suffered predominantly from OSAS, hypersomnia and insufficient sleep syndrome. Subjects were deliberately aroused once, either out of consolidated stage 2 sleep (n = 66) or REM sleep (n = 51) and asked for sleep/wake perception (sleep/wake and related questions). While 81 (69.2%) of the subjects estimated that they had been sleeping or dozing before they were aroused, 36 (30.8%) reported that they had been awake. Awake ratings were significantly more frequent for S 2 (45.5%) than for REM sleep (11.8%). The difference between sleep states was most pronounced for insomniacs (58.1% awake ratings in S2 vs. 5.3% in REM sleep). Mismatches between measured sleep and perceived state are quite frequent, with a greater disparity for S2 than for REM sleep, especially in insomniac patients. We suggest that state judgement is contingent not only on the state of the sleep regulating system but also on cognitive processes associated with processing of external and internal stimuli, and dreaming.Copyright Â© 2017, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,adult;aged;arousal;article;cognition;dreaming;electrophysiology;Epworth sleepiness scale;female;human;hypersomnia;insomnia;major clinical study;male;mental performance;*night sleep;*perception;polysomnography;priority journal;randomized controlled trial;REM sleep;*sleep disorder;sleep disordered breathing;sleep quality;sleep waking cycle;somnolence;stage 2 sleep;wakefulness;Sleep Disorders,,,schulz_2017,Intra-Night Sleep Perception in Patients with Sleep Disorders,"Schulz & Walther, 2017",Germany,,,,,,,1,,,individuals referred to a sleep centre for investigation of sleep disorders,individuals referred for PSG,adults,,,referred for PSG,,,n/a,n/a,117,PSG,1,1,,,,,,n/a,,,,,,,,n/a,n/a,n/a,,,,,,,,,R&K,in-lab,nocturnal,sleep / wake judgement following induced awakenings,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,n/a,,,interview following induced awakening,generic,,,,,,,1,,,,1 night,1,matched,1,,,n/a,n/a,,,,,,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,0,,,,,,,,,,n/a,,,,,,n/a,n/a,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,n/a,n/a,"induced waking: judgements of physiological sleep as sleep/wakefulness; chi-square for sleep/wake perception across sleep stage (REM, N2), similar chi-square for ESS, RSL, insomnia, hypersomnia, narcolepsy, parasomnia, mental activity",,,1,,

E-mail: michelle.short@unisa.edu.au","Objective: To explore the discrepancy between sleep diary and actigraphic measures of sleep in adolescents and to ascertain whether these discrepancies may vary according to characteristics of the participant. Method(s): Participants were 385 adolescents aged 13-18 years (X = 15.6, standard deviation [SD] = 0.95; 60% male) from eight high schools in South Australia. Adolescents completed the School Sleep Habits Survey and Pediatric Daytime Sleepiness Scale during class time, followed by an 8-day sleep diary and wrist actigraphy. The Flinders Fatigue Scale was completed on the final day of the study. Parents completed a sleep, medical, education, and family history survey. Result(s): Actigraphic estimates of wake after sleep onset (WASO) were substantially greater than sleep diary estimates (74 min actigraphy vs. 7 min sleep diary) and actigraphic estimates of total sleep time were substantially less than sleep diary and parent report (6 h 51 min actigraphy vs. 8 h 16 min sleep diary vs. 8 h 51 parent report). Actigraphy displayed no significant relationship with daytime functioning and weak relationships with concomitantly recorded sleep diary variables. Sex and puberty-related differences in actigraphic scoring were found, with more WASO and less sleep scored in boys compared to girls and more WASO scored amongst pubertally-mature boys than boys of less advanced pubertal development. Conclusion(s): There may be differences in the sleep of adolescents that result in less actigraphic total sleep scored than perceived, particularly in boys, possibly because of increased sleep motor activity in adolescents that actigraphic algorithms score as wake. This is a significant concern that requires further examination with polysomnography. Â© 2012 Elsevier B.V.

A.",,,"Objectives: Objective sleep elements that underlie child ratings of sleep quality are largely unknown. Child-based sleep recommendations, therefore, typically focus on duration. An expert panel recently provided specific recommendations regarding objective sleep parameters that correspond with higher quality sleep, but child-based studies from which to draw conclusions were notably limited. The present study used actigraphy and polysomnography to explore sleep continuity and architectural variables that correspond with higher ratings of sleep quality in a sample of school-aged children. Methods: Fifty-two healthy, prepubertal children (aged 7-11 years) completed one night of unattended ambulatory polysomnography at home with concurrent actigraphy and provided sleep quality ratings the following morning. Associations between sleep variables and subjective ratings were examined using polynomial regression models to examine potential linear and nonlinear relationships. Results: In contrast to findings among adults, total sleep time, sleep onset latency, and sleep efficiency values were unrelated to child ratings of sleep quality. Wake after sleep onset (WASO) showed a curvilinear (reversed j-shaped) relationship such that perceptions of sleep quality were high when WASO values were less than approximately 30 minutes. For sleep architecture, N1% showed a significant quadratic association with sleep quality such that N1% between 2% and 6% corresponded with high sleep quality ratings. Conclusions: Our findings support expert recommendations regarding WASO values that predict high quality sleep in children, but also await replication. There is need for additional research aimed at understanding objective sleep elements and other influences of children's perceptions of sleep quality using linear and nonlinear models.

Method(s): Among African-American participants of the Jackson Heart Sleep Study, we investigated differences in self-reported sleep duration assessed by responses to two questions on self-assessed average sleep duration (SAASD) and self-assessed wake-bed time differences (SAWBD) on weekdays and weekends, and compared these responses to objective measures using 7-day wrist actigraphy. We employed linear regression models to assess bias between actigraphy-based and self-reported sleep duration, overall and separately for age, sex, educational attainment, insomnia symptoms, sleep apnea, and depressive symptoms. Result(s): Among 821 adults, mean age was 63.4 +/- 10.7 years, 66.1% were women, and 74.4% had greater than a high school education. Mean weekday SAASD was significantly lower than SAWBD (6.4 +/- 1.4 vs. 7.5 +/- 1.7 hours, p<0.0001). Mean actigraphy-based total sleep time was 6.6 +/- 1.2 hours, and actigraphy-based average time in bed was 7.6 +/- 1.2 hours. Weekday SAASD and actigraphy-based total sleep time were modestly correlated (r=0.28, p<0.0001) and demonstrated slight agreement (kappa=0.1848). SAASD underestimated weekday actigraphy-based total sleep time by approximately -30.7 (95% confidence intervals (CI): -36.5- -24.9) minutes. In contrast, SAWBD overestimated weekday sleep duration by approximately 45.1 (95% CI: 38.6-51.5) minutes compared to actigraphy-based total sleep time. Bias for weekend sleep was similar to weekday sleep. In subgroup analyses, SAASD significantly underestimated actigraphy-based measures among those with insomnia symptoms and, for weekend SAASD only, among those with less than a high school education and those aged 65+ years. We also observed a lower correlation (0.19 vs. 0.35, p<0.05) between SAASD and actigraphy-based sleep among participants with insomnia symptoms. Conclusion(s): Among African Americans, SAASD underestimated objectively-measured sleep while SAWBD overestimated objectively-measured sleep. Sleep measurement property differences should be considered when investigating disparities in sleep and evaluating its association with health outcomes.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,actimetry;adult;*African American;controlled study;depression;female;*heart;high school;human;insomnia;linear regression analysis;major clinical study;male;mental capacity;middle aged;outcome assessment;sleep disordered breathing;*sleep time;wrist;conference abstract;Sleep,,,jackson_2020,Concordance between self-reported and objectively-assessed sleep duration among African-American adults: Findings from the Jackson Heart Sleep Study,"Jackson et al., 2019",USA,,,1,,,,,,,African-American adults,African-American adults,adults,,,normative,,,n/a,n/a,821,Actigraphy,,,1,1,,,,ActiGraph GT3X+,,,Cole-Kripke,,,,,ActiLife version 6.13,ActiLife,"manual: sleep diary, activity, light",,1,1,1,,,,,n/a,n/a,,"TST, TIB",,,,standard,,,,,,,,,1,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,n/a,,,habitual sleep questionnaire,generic,,,,,,1,,,,,7 nights,7,habitual,,1,,n/a,direct question,question,,1,,,LO-RT,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,0,,,,,,,,,,n/a,,,,,,n/a,mean values,,1,,,,,,,,1,1,,,1,,,1,,,,,,,,n/a,"linear regression ( intercept=concordance, slope = calibration), spearman correlations, bland altman, cohens kappa for categorised variables; analyses stratified weeknight/weekday",suest command for seemingly unrelated estimation testing intercepts for stratified linear regressions; differences between correlations tested via bootstrap; wald tests for interactions,1,1,,,

To account for these inconsistencies, some authors hypothesize that PTSD-diagnosed individuals have sleep-state misperception; that is, they self-report experiencing poor sleep quality, but objectively sleep relatively normally. We tested this sleep-state misperception hypothesis, collecting data on subjectively-reported sleep quality (in the home, and in the laboratory) and on objectively-measured, laboratory-based, sleep quality in PTSD-diagnosed participants from low socioeconomic status South African communities. Women with PTSD (n = 21), with trauma exposure but no PTSD (TE; n = 19), and healthy controls (HC; n = 20) completed questionnaires on their average sleep quality in the past 30 days, and on their sleep quality after a night (8 h) of polysomnographic-monitored sleep in the laboratory. PTSD-diagnosed individuals reported poorer everyday subjective sleep quality than TE and HC individuals. In the laboratory, however, there were no between-group differences in subjective sleep quality, and few between-group differences in objective sleep quality (PTSD-diagnosed individuals only had decreased sleep depth). Furthermore, whereas measures of laboratory-based objective and subjective sleep quality correlated significantly, especially in PTSD-diagnosed individuals, there were few significant associations between objective sleep measures and everyday subjective sleep quality. Taken together, these findings suggest that PTSD-diagnosed individuals likely experienced better sleep quality in the laboratory than at home. Descriptive observations corroborated this interpretation, with almost half the sample rating their laboratory sleep (which they described as ""safe"" and ""quiet"") as better than their home sleep (which was experienced in an atmosphere marked by high levels of violence and nighttime noise). These findings disconfirm the sleep-state misperception hypothesis as related to PTSD, and suggest that the laboratory environment may influence sleep quality positively in these individuals. Many investigations of sleep in PTSD do not consider the influence of the laboratory environment. Our findings suggest that future studies in this field should consider that sleep-state misperception may be an artifact of the laboratory setting, especially when samples are drawn from communities where violence and crime are an everyday reality.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,"Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic",,,lipinska_2017,Better Sleep in a Strange Bed?

Two factors that could contribute to a cycle of pain and sleeplessness are pre-sleep cognitive arousal (repetitive thought processes) and low mood. This study aimed to examine how pain, sleep disturbance, mood, and pre-sleep cognitive arousal inter-relate, to determine whether low mood or pre-sleep cognitive arousal contribute to a vicious cycle of pain and insomnia. Method(s): Forty seven chronic pain patients completed twice daily diary measures and actigraphy for one week. Analyses investigated the temporal and directional relationships between pain intensity, sleep quality, time awake after sleep onset, anhedonic and dysphoric mood, and pre-sleep cognitive arousal. Fluctuations in predictor variables were used to predict outcome variables the following morning using mixed-effects modelling. Result(s): For people with chronic pain, an evening with greater pre-sleep cognitive arousal (relative to normal) led to a night of poorer sleep (measured objectively and subjectively), lower mood in the morning, and a greater misperception of sleep (underestimating sleep). A night of poorer sleep quality led to greater pain the following morning. Fluctuations in pain intensity and depression did not have a significant influence on subsequent sleep. Conclusion(s): For people with chronic pain, cognitive arousal may be a key variable exacerbating insomnia, which in turn heightens pain. Future studies could target cognitive arousal to assess effects on sleep and pain outcomes.Copyright Â© 2021 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,"actimetry;adult;anhedonia;*arousal;article;*chronic pain;circadian rhythm;clinical article;Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21;disease association;disease duration;disease exacerbation;dysphoria;employment status;exploratory research;female;human;*insomnia;Insomnia Severity Index;male;middle aged;*mood change;*pain intensity;sex factor;sleep latency;sleep quality;sleep time;*stage 1 sleep;temporal analysis;time factor;wake after sleep onset;wakefulness;anticonvulsive agent;nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent;opiate;paracetamol;serotonin noradrenalin reuptake inhibitor;serotonin uptake inhibitor;tricyclic antidepressant agent;Arousal",,,bean_2021,Pre-sleep cognitive arousal exacerbates sleep disturbance in chronic pain: An exploratory daily diary and actigraphy study,"Bean et al., 2021",New Zealand,,,,1,,,,,,chronic pain patients,chronic pain,adults,,,chronic pain,,,n/a,n/a,47,Actigraphy,,,1,1,,,,Actiwatch AW64,,,Actiware (not reported),,,,,Cambridge Neurotechnology Sleep Analysis 5.5,Cambridge Neurotechnology Sleep Analysis 5.5,sleep diary,,1,,,,,,,n/a,n/a,,"TST, SOL, WASO",,,,standard,,actigraphy-defined,,,,,,,1,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,n/a,,,sleep diary,generic,1,,,,,,,,,,7 nights,7,matched,1,,,n/a,direct question,question,,1,,,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"sTST-oTST, sSOL-oSOL",1,dTST,dSOL,,,,,,,,n/a,1,,,,,n/a,linear mixed models,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,n/a,n/a,n/a,,,,,

METHOD(S): In 2,980 men from the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men Sleep Study and 2,855 women from the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures we examined the agreement and accuracy of self-reported vs actigraphy-measured short and normal (> 6 but < 9 hours) sleep duration. We evaluated associations of select factors (demographics; medical, physical, and neuropsychiatric conditions; medication and substance use; and sleep-related measures) with risk of false-negative (normal sleep duration by self-report but short sleep duration by actigraphy) and false-positive (short sleep duration by self-report and normal sleep duration by actigraphy) designations, respectively, using logistic regression. RESULT(S): Average ages were 76.3 +/- 5.5 and 83.5 +/- 3.7 years in men and women, respectively. There was poor agreement between self-reported and actigraphic sleep duration (kappa <=0.24). False negatives occurred in nearly half and false positives in over a quarter of older persons. In multivariable models in men and women, false negatives were independently associated with obesity, daytime sleepiness, and napping, while false positives were significantly lower with obesity. CONCLUSION(S): Under- and overreporting of short sleep is common among older persons.

Method(s): Sixty-three adolescents (M 15.8 2.2 years, 63.5% f) diagnosed with DSWPD and 40 good sleeping adolescents (M 15.9 2.4 years, 75% f) completed baseline measures of sleep, daytime functioning and cognitive 'insomnia' processes (i.e., repetitive negative thinking, physiological hyperarousal, distress, sleep-related attention and monitoring, sleep misperception). Sixty DSWPD adolescents (M 15.9 2.2 y, 63% f) entered a treatment trial and received 3 weeks of light therapy. Sleep, daytime functioning, and insomnia were measured again post-treatment and at 3-month follow-up. Result(s): Adolescents with DSWPD had significantly later sleep timing (d 0.99 '1.50), longer sleep latency (d 1.14), and shorter total sleep time (d 0.85) on school nights, compared with the good sleeping adolescents. There was evidence of cognitive 'insomnia' symptoms, with the DSWPD group reporting more repetitive negative thinking (d 0.70 '1.02), trait hyperarousal (d 0.55), distress (d 2.19), sleep associated monitoring (d 0.76), and sleep onset misperception (d 1.29). Across treatment and follow-up, adolescents with DSWPD reported advanced sleep timing (d 0.54 '0.62), reduced sleep latency (d 0.53), increased total sleep time (d 0.49), and improved daytime functioning (d 0.46 '1.00). Repetitive negative thinking (d 0.64 '0.96), physiological arousal (d 0.69), distress (d 0.87), and sleep onset misperception (d 0.37) also showed improvement. Conclusion(s): Cognitive 'insomnia' processes may be implicated in the development and maintenance of DSWPD in adolescents. Many of these processes are amendable to chronobiological treatment; however, residual symptoms may place adolescents at risk of poor treatment outcome or relapse.Copyright Â© 2018 American Psychological Association.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,actimetry;adolescent;arousal;article;attention;distress syndrome;follow up;human;*insomnia;major clinical study;phototherapy;*sleep disorder/th [Therapy];sleep latency;sleep quality;sleep time;*sleep waking cycle;*delayed sleep wake phase disorder/th [Therapy];Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders;Cognition,,,richardson_2019,Cognitive 'Insomnia' Processes in Delayed Sleep'Wake Phase Disorder: Do They Exist and Are They Responsive to Chronobiological Treatment?

Since polysomnography (PSG) typically shows only modest sleep impairment, some still unidentified property of sleep, not mirrored in PSG, may be modified in insomnia. One possible mechanistic hypothesis is that insomnia patients may be more sensitive to inevitably occurring internal or external stimuli during the night, causing brief sleep disruptions then perceived as wake time. Method(s): Auditory event-related potentials (ERP) to low intensity (50 dB SPL) synthesized guitar tones played continuously throughout two nights of polysomnographically registered sleep were obtained in fifty patients with insomnia disorder (ID, without comorbidities) and 50 age- and sex-matched good sleeper controls (GSC) for each sleep stage and NREM/REM cycle. Phasic and tonic REM were treated as separate stages. Latencies and amplitudes of components P1, N1 and P2 were measured and analyzed by multivariate repeated-measures ANCOVA including effects of group, night, cycle, and age. Result(s): ID showed reduced P2 amplitudes relative to GSC specifically in phasic REM sleep. The same reduction also correlated with the amount of sleep misperception across groups. Independent component analysis showed a frontal negativity to contribute most to this group difference. Conclusion(s): The present finding can be interpreted as increased mismatch negativity (MMN) in ID, reflecting automated detection of change in the auditory system and a concomitant orienting response. Specifically phasic REM sleep appears to be vulnerable to sensory afferences in ID patients, possibly contributing to the perception of being awake.

Method(s): We investigated sleep via actigraphy and e-diary on 6 consecutive nights in a group of 117 women with PTSD after childhood abuse (CA; PTSD group), a group of 31 mentally healthy women with a history of CA (healthy trauma controls, HTC group) and a group of 36 nontraumatized mentally healthy women (healthy controls, HC group). Result(s): The PTSD group reported lower sleep quality, more nights with nightmares, and shorter sleep duration than both HTC and HC. Actigraphic measures showed more and longer sleep interruptions in the PTSD group compared to HTC and HC, but no difference in sleep duration. While the PTSD group underestimated their sleep duration, both HTC and HC overestimated their sleep duration. HTC did not differ from HC regarding sleep impairments. Conclusion(s): Sleep in women with PTSD after CA seems to be more fragmented but not shorter compared to sleep patterns of mentally healthy control subjects. The results suggest a stronger effect of PTSD psychopathology on sleep compared to the effect of trauma per se.

Based on the misperception index (MI), participants were classified into NSSM (MI > 0, n = 115) and PSSM (MI < 0, n = 35) groups., RESULTS: The PSSM group had more N3 sleep on nocturnal PSG than the NSSM group (p=0.002). The NSSM group showed a higher PSQI score (p<0.001), longer subjective sleep onset latency (SOL) (p=0.001), and a greater SOL discrepancy (p=0.001). Subjective feelings of tiredness and morning awakenings in the morning were higher in the NSSM group (p=0.029 and p=0.038). The MI negatively correlated with a proportion of N3 sleep (p=0.005) and positively correlated with PSQI (p<0.001), morning awakenings (p=0.01), subjective SOL (p<0.001), and SOL discrepancy (p<0.001) in insomnia patients. Multiple regression analysis showed that N3 sleep, PSQI, and morning awakenings were significantly associated with MI in insomnia patients., CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of slow-wave sleep and subjective measures may be associated with perception of sleep in insomnia patients. Objective and subjective characteristics of insomnia patients should be carefully evaluated and managed because they may influence the perception of sleep.

The present study compared actigraphic and subjective estimates of sleep to the gold standard, polysomnography (PSG). Method(s): In-flight (25 episodes) and layover sleep (21 episodes) of 21 flight crew were measured with PSG and actigraphy. Subjective reports were made 30 min after in-flight sleep episodes. Actigraphy data were analyzed at low, medium, and high activity thresholds. Result(s): Actigraphic and subjective estimates of sleep duration correlated highly with PSG (range 0.84-0.95), regardless of sleep location or activity threshold. Mean differences were relatively small (-36-20 min), but the 95% confidence intervals of the differences were wide (+/- 71-+/- 103 min), particularly for subjective estimates (+/- 112 min). Actigraphic estimates of sleep efficiency and latency showed moderate to poor correlation with PSG values. Epoch-by-epoch comparisons showed the actigraph was sensitive to sleep (83-95%), but not very specific (34-62%). Kappa values indicated only weak agreement (< 0.4). Discussion(s): For estimating mean sleep duration, both actigraphic and subjective estimates are sufficiently close to PSG values, but the amount of random error must be considered. Any single estimate may vary by more than 1 h from the mean difference. Neither actigraphy nor subjective estimates are suitable for estimating sleep efficiency and latency. Findings indicate that the performance of the actigraph is not altered in flight, other than the predictable effects associated with shorter, more disturbed sleep.

Inoue, Department of Somnology, Tokyo Medical University, Tokyo, Japan","Previous studies have reported that insomniacs tend to have a discrepancy between nocturnal sleep length reported in a self-checked sleep diary and actigraphically recorded sleep length. However, a predictive marker for the presence of this phenomenon remains unclear. In order to clarify this issue, we calculated subjective-objective difference (SOD), using diary estimates of sleep period time (SPT) minus actigraphically measured total sleep time (TST), and investigated the relationship between SOD and descriptive measures, including the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Participants of the present study consisted of 50 persons having subjective insomnia (mean age: 46.6 +/- 11.9 years; 33 males, 17 females). All the participants were divided into three groups based on SOD values (positive group, intermediate group, and negative group). The negative group showed significantly worse PSQI scores for C1 (sleep quality), C2 (sleep onset latency), C4 (sleep efficiency), and C6 (use of sleep medications), compared to the other two groups, whereas no significant difference was found in C7 (daytime dysfunction) among the three groups. The results of the present study indicate that a negative value of SOD, a measure for evaluating the severity of paradoxical insomnia, increases along with aggravation of subjective sleep disturbance among insomniacs.Copyright Â© 2014 Bentham Science Publishers.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,"actimetry;adult;age;article;brain function;clinical article;female;human;*insomnia;latent period;male;Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index;priority journal;questionnaire;*sleep disorder;sleep parameters;sleep pattern;sleep quality;sleep stage;sleep time;*sleep state misperception;subjective objective difference;Sleep Disorders, Intrinsic",,,narisawa_2015,Characteristics of insomniacs having sleep state misperception,"Narisawa et al., 2015",Japan,,,,1,,,,,,participants with subjective sleep difficulty,sleep complaint,adults,,,sleep complaint,,,n/a,n/a,50,Actigraphy,,,1,1,,,,Actiwatch,,,not reported,,,1,,not reported,not reported,activity levels,,,,1,,,,,n/a,n/a,,"TST (actigraphy), SPT (diary)",,,,standard,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,n/a,,,sleep diary,generic,,,,,,,,,,,7 nights,7,matched,1,,,n/a,n/a,,,,,,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,sSPT-oTST to trichotomy ,1,dSPT,,,,,,,,,trichotomy,1,,,,,algebraic difference score,not reported,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,n/a,n/a,,,,,,

Method(s): The participants were 52 pairs of infants and mothers. Infant sleep measures were obtained through the actigraphs (Micro-mini RC, Ambulatory Monitoring Inc., Ardsley, NY, USA) and sleep diaries for over a period of 7 days. Result(s): The results showed that the concordance in sleep measures derived from two methods showed decreases in the following order: sleep offset time [r = 0.91 (p = 0.00)], sleep onset time r = 0.89 (p = 0.00), nocturnal sleep duration [r = 0.75 (p = 0.00)], the number of night wakings [r = 0.46 (p < 0.01)] and WASO [r = 0.34 (p < 0.05)]. It was revealed that the accuracy of sleep diary records was affected by the sleeping place and varied throughout the study period. Conclusion(s): It was confirmed that the sleep measures indicating sleep schedule reported from the sleep diaries had high concordances compared with the data from the actigraphs. Using the sleep diary was recommended to understand behaviours when focusing on infant's daily rhythms. In terms of accuracy and stability of recording throughout the study period, understanding sleep quality and independence of sleeping places, the choice of actigraph was recommended.

Issues regarding patient populations, monitoring duration and timing (nocturnal versus continuous), as well as practical problems encountered in critical care studies using polysomnography are considered with regard to future interventional studies on sleep. Polysomnography is the gold standard in objectively measuring the quality and quantity of sleep. However, it is difficult to undertake, particularly in patients recovering from critical illness in an acute-care area. Therefore, other objective (actigraphy and bispectral index) and subjective (nurse or patient assessment) methods have been used in other critical care studies. Each of these techniques has its own particular advantages and disadvantages. We use data from an interventional study to compare agreement between four of these alternative techniques in the measurement of nocturnal sleep quantity. Recommendations for further developments in sleep monitoring techniques for research and clinical application are made. Also, methodological problems in studies validating various sleep measurement techniques are explored.

Using a sample of 90 African American 3-month olds, we compare correlations and discrepancies for seven sleep variables across each of the three pairs of assessment methods for one night of a week-long sleep study. These seven variables are indicative of sleep schedule (e.g. sleep onset time, rise time), duration (e.g. sleep period, sleep time, wake time), and fragmentation (e.g. night wakings, longest sleep period). We find that across all sleep assessment methods, correlations are highest for variables indicative of sleep schedule, and lowest for variables indicative of sleep fragmentation. Comparing the magnitude and significance of the discrepancies, we find that actigraphy and sleep diaries significantly overestimate sleep period duration and underestimate the number of night waking episodes, compared with videosomnography. Actigraphy and sleep diaries were more concordant with one another than with videosomnography. Epoch-by-epoch analyses indicated that actigraphy had low sensitivity to detect wakefulness, compared with videosomnography. Contrary to our hypothesis, the discrepancies between sleep assessment methods did not vary widely based on infant sleep location (own room vs. parent's room) or sleep surface (own bed vs. parent's bed).

To test such hypotheses, we need to know how to accurately and consistently assess habitual sleep in infancy. Common assessment methods include easy to deploy but subjective parent-report measures (diary/sleep questionnaire); or more labour-intensive but objective motor movement measures (actigraphy). Understanding the degree to which these methods provide converging insights is important, but cross-method agreement has yet to be investigated longitudinally. Moreover, it is unclear whether concordance systematically varies with infant or maternal characteristics that could represent confounders in observational studies. This longitudinal study (up to 4 study visits/participant) investigated cross-method concordance on one objective (7-day actigraphy) and three commonly used subjective (7-day sleep diary, Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire, Sleep & Settle Questionnaire) sleep measures in 76 typically developing infants (age: 4-14 months) and assessed the impact of maternal characteristics (stress, age, education) and infant characteristics (age) on cross-method concordance. In addition, associations between objective and subjective sleep measures and a measure of general developmental status (Ages & Stages Questionnaire) were investigated. A range of equivalence analyses (tests of equivalence, correlational analyses, Bland-Altman plots) showed mixed agreement between sleep measures. Most importantly, cross-method agreement was associated with maternal stress levels and infant age. Specifically, agreement between different measures of night waking was better for mothers experiencing higher stress levels and was higher for younger than older infants; the reverse pattern was true for day sleep duration. Interestingly, objective and subjective measures did not yield the same patterns of association with developmental domains, indicating that sleep method choice can influence which associations are found between sleep and cognitive development. However, results converged across day sleep and problem-solving skills, highlighting the importance of studying day sleep in future studies. We discuss implications of sleep method choice for investigating sleep in the context of studying infant development and behaviour.Copyright Â© 2021 The Authors","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,*actimetry;article;child;child development;*cognitive development;confounding variable;education;female;human;human experiment;infancy;infant;longitudinal study;major clinical study;*maternal stress;*mood;observational study;preschool child;problem solving;questionnaire;skill;*sleep time;wakefulness;Infant;Maternal Age;Cognition,,,,Concordance between subjective and objective measures of infant sleep varies by age and maternal mood: Implications for studies of sleep and cognitive development,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Data are lacking comparing the validity of parent-reported versus child-reported sleep parameters., METHODS: A total of 285 children (age 9 to 17 years) from the Tucson Children's Assessment of Sleep Apnea community cohort study were assessed. Parent report and child report of total sleep time (TST), sleep latency (SL), and sleep efficiency (SE) for a single night were compared to polysomnography (PSG). Intraclass correlations (ICCs) were used to evaluate agreement between child report, parent report, and PSG findings., RESULTS: When compared to PSG, children overestimated TST by a median of 32 minutes (interquartile range [IQR] 6 to 68), whereas parents overestimated TST by 36 minutes (IQR 13-70) (P = .006). Children overestimated SL by 4 minutes (IQR -8 to 20), whereas parents overestimated SL by 2 minutes (IQR -10 to 13) (P = .001). Children overestimated SE by 5% (IQR 0% to 11%), whereas parents overestimated SE by 6% (IQR 2% to 11%, P = .04). Both child-reported TST (ICC 0.722, P < .001) and parent-reported TST (ICC 0.776, P < .001) agreed substantially with PSG. Child-reported SL (ICC 0.467, P < .001) and parent-reported SL (r = .419, P < .001) moderately agreed with PSG. Least agreement with PSG was seen between child-reported SE (ICC 0.404, P < .001) and parent-reported SE (ICC 0.473, P < .001), but significant agreement was still present., CONCLUSIONS: When compared to PSG, children overestimate TST to a smaller degree than their parents and overestimate SL to a larger degree than their parents, but these differences appear small. Child and parent reports appear to be equally valid for TST, SL, and SE.

Conversely, actigraphy provides objective assessments of sleep patterns. In this study, we aimed to determine the potential discrepancies between parentally-based sleep logs and concurrent actigraphic recordings in children over a one-week period., METHODS: We studied 327 children aged 3-10 years, and included otherwise healthy, nonsnoring children from the community who were reported by their parents to be nonsnorers and had normal polysomnography, habitually-snoring children from the community who completed the same protocol, and children with primary insomnia referred to the sleep clinic for evaluation in the absence of any known psychiatric illness. Actigraphy and parental sleep log were concomitantly recorded during one week., RESULTS: Sleep logs displayed an average error in sleep onset after bedtime of about 30 minutes (P < 0.01) and of a few minutes before risetime in all groups. Furthermore, subjective parental reports were associated with an overestimated misperception of increased sleep duration of roughly one hour per night independent of group (P < 0.001)., CONCLUSION: The description of a child's sleep by the parent appears appropriate as far as symptoms are concerned, but does not result in a correct estimate of sleep onset or duration. We advocate combined parental and actigraphic assessments in the evaluation of sleep complaints, particularly to rule out misperceptions and potentially to aid treatment. Actigraphy provides a more reliable tool than parental reports for assessing sleep in healthy children and in children with sleep problems.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,Only Child;Child,,,,Sleep estimates in children: parental versus actigraphic assessments,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although viewed as an objective measure, actigraphy has overestimated night-waking. Sleep diaries are criticized for only documenting night-waking with infant crying. To support potential outcome measure validity, we examined differences between sleep diaries and actigraphy in detecting night-waking and sleep duration. We recruited 5.5 to 8-month-old infants for a behavioral sleep intervention trial conducted from 2009 to 2011. Intervention (sleep education and support) and control groups (safety education and support) collected infant diary and actigraphy data for 5 days. We compared night-time sleep actigraphy with diary data at baseline (194 cases), and 6 weeks (166 cases) and 24 weeks post-education (118 cases). We hypothesized numbers of wakes and wakes of >=20 min would be higher and longest sleep time and total sleep time shorter by actigraphy compared with diaries. Using paired t-tests, there were significantly more actigraphy night wakes than diary wakes at baseline (t = 29.14, df = 193, p < 0.001), 6 weeks (t = 23.99, df = 165, p < 0.001), and 24 weeks (t = 22.01, df = 117, p < 0.001); and significantly more night wakes of >=20 min by actigraphy than diary at baseline (t = 5.03, df = 183, p < 0.001), and 24 weeks (t = 2.19, df = 107, p < 0.05), but not 6 weeks (t = 1.37, df = 156, n.s.). Longest sleep duration was significantly higher by diary than actigraphy at baseline (t = 14.71, df = 186, p < 0.001), 6 weeks (t = 7.94, df = 158, p < 0.001), and 24 weeks (t = 17.18, df = 114, p < 0.001).

However, measuring children's sleep is challenging, especially in situations where objective assessment is impractical. This study aimed to assess age and proxy effects in comparing subjective sleep duration with objective measures, in a community-based sample of Wisconsin children (aged 6-17 years), recruited from 2014-2017. The sample participants had a mean age of 11.4 (standard deviation, 3.3) years and 52% of them were male. We used linear mixed effects models to test for age effects in proxy- and self-report groups separately, and a quasiexperimental regression discontinuity approach to compare subjective sleep duration with objective actigraphy estimates across proxy- and self-report groups. We found evidence of systematic overestimation of sleep duration when using subjective measurements but did not find evidence of age effects in either group. Based on these analyses, we found evidence of differential overestimation by proxy- or self-report condition. Proxy reporters overestimated sleep duration by 2.3 hours (95% confidence interval: 2.2, 2.4), compared with 1.0 hour (95% confidence interval: 0.7, 1.2) for self-reporters. These findings suggest that proxy- versus self-reporting conditions are an important consideration when designing a study, and that it might be beneficial to reduce the age at which children self-report.

Sleep researchers face many methodological choices that have implications for the reliability and validity of the data. Here, the authors directly investigated the impact of design and measurement choices in a small, longitudinal sample of infants. Three sleep measurement techniques-parent-reported sleep diaries, actigraphy (Micromini Sleep Watch), and a commercial videosomnography (Nanit)-were included, using actigraphy as the baseline. Nine infants' sleep (4girls) was measured longitudinally using all three measurement techniques. Nanit provided summary statistics, using a proprietary algorithm, for nightly sleep parameters. The actigraphy data were analyzed with both the Sadeh Infant and Sadeh algorithms. The extent to which measurements converged on sleep start and end time, number of wake episodes, sleep efficiency, and sleep duration was assessed. Measures were positively correlated. Difference scores revealed similar patterns of greater sleep estimation in parent reports and Nanit compared with actigraphy. Bland-Altman plots revealed that much of the data were within the limits of agreement, tentatively suggesting that Nanit and actigraphy may be used interchangeably. Graphs display significant variability within and between individual infants as well as across measurement techniques. Potential confounding variables that may explain the discrepancies between parent report, Sadeh Infant, Sadeh, and Nanit are discussed. The findings are also used to speak to the advantages and disadvantages of design and measurement choices. Future directions focus on the unique contributions of each measurement technique and how to capitalize on them.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,*actimetry;child parent relation;female;human;infant;male;methodology;polysomnography;*procedures;self report;*sleep;*videorecording;Infant,,,,"Researcher Choices for Infant Sleep Assessment: Parent Report, Actigraphy, and a Novel Video System",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Design(s): Case-control study. Setting(s): A child and adolescent psychiatric department of a teaching hospital. Participant(s): Two hundred six children aged 5 to 11 years, including 45 with a diagnosis of ADHD, 64 with a diagnosis of other psychiatric diagnoses (psychiatric control group), and 97 healthy control subjects (reference group). Intervention(s): Sleep was monitored by parent-completed sleep diaries and 5 nights of actigraphy. We used a semistructured interview to diagnose psychiatric disorders according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition) criteria. Main Outcome Measure(s): Actigraphically measured sleep variables and parent-estimated sleep by diary. Result(s): We found that children with ADHD have significantly longer sleep onset latency and a more irregular sleep pattern than the psychiatric control or healthy reference subjects. Average sleep onset latencies were 26.3 minutes in the ADHD group, 18.6 minutes in the psychiatric control group, and 13.5 minutes in the healthy reference group. There was no apparent relationship between sleep problems and comorbid oppositional defiant disorder. We found discrepancies between the objectively measured sleep variables and those reported by parents, who overestimated sleep onset latency. Conclusion(s): The results of this study allow us to conclude that some children with ADHD have impaired sleep that cannot be referred to comorbid oppositional defiant disorder. However, it is important to make an in-depth review of the sleep complaints, as the problem may be a product of the parents' perception rather than the child's actual experience.

Method(s): Forty-six patients with AD living with their caregivers participated. Before study entry, all caregivers reported poor patient sleep quality using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) Nighttime Behavior Scale. Patient sleep-wake activity was recorded for one week using an Actillume wrist-movement recorder. Result(s): Although all patients were reported by caregivers to have multiple sleep disturbances, 41% of patients had actigraphic sleep efficiencies in the normal range and 43% averaged eight or more hours of sleep nightly. In bivariate analyses, greater patient percent nighttime sleep (indicative of more discrepancy between subjective reports and objective outcomes) was associated with less patient cognitive, physical and functional impairment, lower self-rated depression, higher self-rated quality of life, and less daytime sleepiness. No patient variable significantly predicted total patient nocturnal sleep time. In both bivariate and multivariate analyses, greater patient percent sleep and total sleep time were also associated with caregiver factors, particularly greater use of criticism as a behavior management strategy. Conclusion(s): The study suggests that both patient and caregiver factors contribute to reported sleep problems in community-dwelling patients with AD, and that caregiver reports and objective sleep assessments frequently may not agree.

The sleep patterns of 59 normal kindergarten children (mean age = 5.5 years) were monitored for 4 to 5 consecutive nights by means of activity monitors (actigraph) and by means of parental daily sleep logs. The correlation between the actigraphic measures and the daily parental logs indicated that parents were accurate reporters of sleep schedule measures. However, parents were less accurate in assessing sleep quality measures, significantly underestimating the number of night-wakings and overestimating the quality of their children's sleep. Fragmented sleep was found, by means of activity monitoring, in 41% of the children.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,article;child;*child development;child parent relation;female;human;Israel/ep [Epidemiology];male;*parent;physiology;polysomnography;preschool child;prevalence;psychological aspect;*sleep;*sleep disorder/ep [Epidemiology];wakefulness;Only Child;Child;Sleep,,,,Sleep patterns and sleep disruptions in kindergarten children,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Structured interviews, validated sleep questionnaires, and 1Â week of actigraphy data were utilized. Despite subjective reports of significantly greater sleep problems among anxious children, actigraphy data revealed no significant differences between the groups. All parents estimated earlier bedtimes and greater total sleep duration relative to actigraphy, and all children endorsed more sleep problems than parents. With few exceptions, subjective reports exhibited low and non-significant correspondence with actigraphy-based sleep patterns and problems. Our findings suggest that high rates of sleep complaints found among children with GAD (and their parents) are not corroborated by objective sleep abnormalities, with the exception of marginally prolonged sleep onset latency compared to controls. Objective-subjective sleep discrepancies were observed in both groups but more apparent overall in the GAD group. Frequent complaints of sleep problems and daytime tiredness among anxious youth might more accurately reflect difficulties prior to the actual sleep period, cognitive-affective biases associated with sleep, and/or poor sleep quality. Findings highlight the importance of considering sleep from multiple perspectives.","research. Journal Subset: Biomedical; USA. Special Interest: Pediatric Care; Psychiatry/Psychology.

Twenty-two school-aged children with DS, 24 with WS and 52 typically developing (TD) children took part in the study. Each child wore an actiwatch for a minimum of four nights and parents completed the Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ). Sleep problems were common in both developmental disorders. Children with DS had the greatest sleep disruption, with frequent and longer night wakings as well as restlessness. Parents reported symptoms of sleep-disordered breathing and a range of other problems including grinding teeth, bedtime resistance and sleep anxiety. Children with WS had problems initiating sleep and parents also reported bed-wetting and body pain. Despite these problems, the mean actual sleep time, as measured by actigraphy, did not differ between the three groups. CSHQ reports were in agreement with actigraphy for children's sleep duration, but this was not the case for sleep latency, restlessness and the night wakings variables. Sleep problems in DS and WS are common and appear to be syndrome-specific. Due to the inaccuracy of parent report, it is recommended that children at risk undergo objective measures of sleep assessment.

Three criteria were applied to find the minimum sleep time (20, 30 and 40â€‰min) yielding the best nap agreement between diaries and actigraphy for nap/no-nap identification. Best agreements were 72.1% (20â€‰min minimum), 78.4% (20â€‰min), 91.0% (30â€‰min) and 93.3% (30â€‰min) for ages 6 months, 1, 2 and 3Â½ years, respectively. Kappa statistics classified nap-nap agreement as 'slight' for 6-month data but 'moderate' or 'almost perfect' for older age groups. The number of daytime naps extracted at each age group yielded no significant discrepancies between the methods. Diaries generally returned significantly earlier sleep onset, later sleep offset, longer sleep duration and fewer night wakings at 6 months and 1 and 2 years, but this was not significant at 3Â½ or 5 years of age.Conclusions: Minimum age-specific sleep time thresholds are recommended to improve nap identification in actigraphy across infant and toddler age groups.

The aim of this study was to determine the sleep-wake structure of excessively crying infants throughout a 24-hour cycle. METHODS: A 24-hour sleep polygraphy study was conducted at home for 24 excessively crying infants and 23 control subjects at the age of 6 weeks. In addition, parental diaries were kept for 4 days. RESULTS: In sleep polygraphy recordings, no major differences between study groups were observed in either the duration or the structure of the 24-hour sleep. In the diaries, the parents overestimated the amount of sleep in both study groups. The parents of the control infants overestimated the amount of sleep more than the parents of excessively crying infants (69.8 minutes [standard deviation: 79.3] compared with 27.1 minutes [standard deviation: 65.4], respectively). In excessively crying infants, the proportion of rapid eye movement sleep was higher during the 3-hour period from the beginning of the first long sleep in the evening and lower during the preceding 3-hour period compared with the control group. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that diary-based studies are prone to be biased as the parents of the control infants are more likely to overestimate the amount of infant's sleep and, therefore, report more sleep than the parents of the crying infants. Although no differences in the total amount of sleep or proportions of sleep stages were observed, excessively crying infants may be characterized by a disturbance that affects rapid eye movement and non-rapid eye movement sleep stage proportion during evening hours.","research; tables/charts.

The objective of this paper is to examine whether night-time sleep parameters of exclusively breastfed or exclusively formula-fed infants differ, and whether correspondence between parental reports and objective measures varies by feeding type.Methods: Mother-infant dyads intending to breastfeed or formula-feed exclusively for 18 weeks were recruited. Mothers were multiparas and primiparas, aged between 18 and 45 years. Infants were full-term, normal birthweight singletons. Maternal report and actigraphic data on infant sleep were collected fortnightly, from four to 18 weeks postpartum. Data were analysed cross-sectionally using t-tests and GLM analysis to control for interaction between feed-type and sleep location.Results: Actigraphy-assessed infant sleep parameters did not vary by feed-type but parentally reported sleep parameters did. Maternal report and actigraphy data diverged at 10 weeks postpartum and discrepancies were associated with infant feeding type. Compared to actigraphy, maternal reports by formula-feeding mothers (controlling for infant sleep location) over-estimated infant's Total Sleep Time (TST) at 10 weeks and Longest Sleep Period (LSP) at 10, 12 and 18 weeks.Conclusions: These results raise questions about the outcomes of previous infant sleep studies where accuracy of parentally-reported infant sleep data is assumed. That parental reports of infant sleep vary by feeding type is particularly important for reconsidering previous studies of infant sleep development and intervention studies designed to influence sleep outcomes, especially where feed-type was heterogeneous, but was not considered as an independent variable.","research.

Eighty-nine percent of the mothers and 75% of the fathers also filled out the CBCL (1.5-5). Mother and father CBCL scores were highly correlated. Overall, good correspondence was found between the CBCL filled out by mothers and sleep efficiency and duration derived from maternal sleep diaries (r between -0.39 and -0.25, pâ€‰â‰¤â€‰0.05). Good correspondence was also found between the CBCL filled out by fathers and sleep efficiency as derived from maternal sleep diaries (r between -0.39 and -0.24, pâ€‰â‰¤â€‰0.05), but not with sleep duration (all results were non-significant). Very few correlations between actigraphy and the CLBL scores reached statistical significance. The Bland and Altman method revealed that sleep diaries and actigraphy showed poor agreement with one another when assessing sleep duration and sleep efficiency. However, diary- and actigraphy-derived sleep durations were significantly correlated. Consistent with findings among older groups of children, this study suggests that the CBCL sleep items, sleep diaries, and actigraphy tap into quite different aspects of sleep among toddlers. The choice of which measures to use should be based on the exact aspects of sleep that one aims to assess. Overall, despite its frequent use, the composite sleep score of the CBCL shows poor links to objective measures of sleep duration and sleep efficiency.","1664-0640     BÃ©langer, Marie-Ãˆve     Simard, ValÃ©rie     Bernier, Annie     Carrier, Julie     Journal Article     2014/11/27     Front Psychiatry. 2014 Nov 10;5:158. doi: 10.3389/fpsyt.2014.00158. eCollection 2014. | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,Cbcl;actigraphy;agreement;sleep;sleep diary;toddlers;Child Behavior,,,,"Investigating the Convergence between Actigraphy, Maternal Sleep Diaries, and the Child Behavior Checklist as Measures of Sleep in Toddlers",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Eight-month-old infants (nâ€¯=â€¯24 per site) were recruited from towns in the Netherlands and the eastern U.S.A. To evaluate sleep, infants' physical activity was recorded at home for 24â€¯h using a miniature actigraph, while parents kept a diary of infant activities. Measures derived from actigraphy include total sleep, longest sleep episode, longest wake episode, number of sleep episodes, and percent of sleep during nighttime, as well as time in the stages of Quiet and Active Sleep. Measures based on the parental diaries include most of these aspects as well, except those related to sleep stages. Results based on the more precise actigraphy method indicate that (1) the Dutch infants averaged 13.65â€¯h of sleep per 24â€¯h, 1.67â€¯h more than the U.S. infants; this difference was mostly due to daytime sleep; (2) The Dutch infants' longest wake episode averaged less than that of the U.S. infants, while their longest sleep episode appeared slightly longer. (3) The Dutch infants, compared to the U.S. sample, spent more time in the Quiet, rather than the Active phase of sleep; (4) They began their Quiet sleep earlier in the evening than did their U.S. counterparts. Measures derived from parental diaries are largely in agreement with the actigraph findings. These results are consistent with reported and observed practices and beliefs in the two communities. The pattern of differences - less apparent maturity among the Dutch in the amount of sleep, but greater apparent maturity in the structure of sleep -- illustrates that behavioral and neurological maturity can be assessed only in the context of the developing child's adaptation to the specific demands and affordances of the culturally structured developmental niche.","research.

METHOD(S): An observational study was conducted in 20 patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for a minimum duration of 24 h, who underwent concurrent sleep monitoring via PSG, ACTG, nursing-based observations, and self-reported assessment using the Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire. RESULT(S): The reported total sleep time (TST) for the 20 participants measured by PSG was 328.2 min (+/-106 min) compared with ACTG (362.4 min [+/-62.1 min]; mean difference = 34.22 min [+/-129 min]). Bland-Altman analysis indicated that PSG and ACTG demonstrated clinical agreement and did not perform differently across a number of sleep variables including TST, awakening, sleep-onset latency, and sleep efficiency. Nursing observations overestimated sleep duration compared to PSG TST (mean difference = 9.95 +/- 136.3 min, p > 0.05), and patient-reported TST was underestimated compared to PSG TST (mean difference = -51.81 +/- 144.1 7, p > 0.05). CONCLUSION(S): Amongst conscious patients treated in the ICU, sleep characteristics measured by ACTG were similar to those measured by PSG. ACTG may provide a clinically feasible and acceptable proxy approach to sleep monitoring in conscious ICU patients.Copyright Â© 2022 Australian College of Critical Care Nurses Ltd.

Method(s): In total, 314 infants participating in the Rise & SHINE (Sleep Health in Infancy & Early Childhood study) cohort in Boston, MA, USA, wore an actigraph on their left ankle for 7 days. Parents concurrently completed a sleep diary and the expanded version of the Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire. Concordance between parent-reported and objective sleep estimates was assessed using Bland-Altman plots, Spearman's rank correlations, intraclass correlations, and linear regression models. Result(s): Mean infant age was 6.4 (0.6 SD) months; 51% were female and 42% were Non-Hispanic white. Mean total sleep duration using actigraphy was 526 (67 SD) minutes per night, 143 (42 SD) minutes per day, and 460 (100 SD) minutes during the longest nighttime sleep period. Relative to actigraphy, parent-completed survey and diary overestimated total day (by 29 and 31 minutes, respectively) and night sleep duration (67 and 43 minutes, respectively) and underestimated the longest sleep (58 minutes), with the highest agreement for sleep onset and offset timing (differences < 30 minutes). There was a tendency toward greater bias among short- and long-sleeping infants. Self-reporting bias for diary-measured longest nighttime sleep and total night sleep duration was higher in infants of parents reporting a problem with their baby's night awakenings and in low-income families, respectively. Conclusion(s): Our findings underscore the need to be cautious when comparing findings across studies using different sleep assessment methods.Copyright Â© 2020 Sleep Research Society 2020.

Methods The sample included 226 families, who were recruited during pregnancy. Data were collected at 3, 6, 12, and 18 months postpartum. Infants' sleep was monitored at home for five nights using actigraphy, sleep diaries, and the BISQ. Outcome measures included WASO and NW, as well as sleep latency, sleep duration, and sleep onset. Results Trajectory analyses demonstrated that all three methods showed declines in NW and WASO from 3 to 18 months. Statistically significant correlations were found between the three methods at all assessment points for all sleep variables. However, agreement rates (using Krippendorff's alpha and Bland-Altman analyses) between actigraphy and parental reports were poor. For NW, agreement between actigraphy and parental reports at 18 months was lower than that at 3 and 6 months. Diaries and BISQ showed satisfactory agreement for sleep latency. Conclusions Although the three methods' measures of infant nocturnal wakefulness are significantly correlated during infancy, absolute agreement between these methods is poor overall. The growing disagreement between actigraphy and parental reports (in NW) across development probably suggests that parents become less aware of infants' awakenings, due to the increasing ability of infants to self-soothe. Using both objective and subjective assessment methods seems especially important after the age of 6 months.Copyright Â© 2018 Sleep Research Society.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,*actimetry;arousal;article;controlled study;female;human;human experiment;infancy;infant;intermethod comparison;Krippendorff's alpha coefficient;*longitudinal study;male;outcome assessment;*questionnaire;*sleep latency;sleep time;*wakefulness;Infant;Wakefulness;Longitudinal Studies,,,,Infant nocturnal wakefulness: A longitudinal study comparing three sleep assessment methods,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The authors had the unique opportunity to compare observational and polysomnographic (PSG) determinations of sleep in a randomized crossover study of sleep-inducing medication in a group of pediatric burn patients. Pediatric burn patients were randomized to one of two regimens with sleep-inducing agents over a 2-week period. PSG was conducted for three consecutive nights each week, between 7-13 and 14-20 days postburn. The first night of monitoring each week was conducted without medication to serve as a baseline. Observational sleep assessments (awake, drowsy, or asleep) were simultaneously recorded every 15 minutes. PSG concordance with observation was based on the PSG sleep stages identified during the 2 minutes before the observations. If all 30-second epochs in the two minutes were designated as sleep stage 1 or above, then the PSG record was categorized as asleep. If all epochs demonstrated wakefulness, an awake status was recorded. Otherwise, the corresponding PSG finding was classified as mixed. Forty patients were enrolled into the study, with a mean age of 9.4 Â± 0.6 years, TBSA burn of 50.1 Â± 2.9%, and third-degree burn surface area of 43.2 Â± 3.6%. Patients were judged according to observational criteria to be awake 9% of the nocturnal study period compared with PSG recordings indicating that the patients were awake 52.3% of the time. The correlation between observation and PSG was poor regardless of sleep agent administration. In conclusion, observational determination of wakefulness in pediatric burn patients correlates poorly with PSG; therefore, PSG is vital in the accurate evaluation of sleep-inducing medications among burn patients.","pictorial; research; tables/charts.

An actigraph was placed on the toddler's ankle and was worn for 3 days and nights. Mothers concurrently completed a sleep diary. Bedtime, nighttime sleep duration, nap duration, and 24-hour sleep duration were collected by both measures. Actigraphy data were analyzed using a combination of manufacturer's scoring algorithm and manual editing. Descriptive statistics and paired samples t-tests were conducted to examine the differences between sleep estimates by a sleep diary and actigraphy.Results: Twenty toddlers (aged 13-42 months) were included in the analyses. Based on actigraphy, 1 toddler went to bed by 9 PM on all 3 nights. Six toddlers achieved 11 to 14 hours of sleep measured in a 24-hour period for 1 of the 3 days, but when sleep was averaged across the study, none achieved this goal. Compared with actigraphy, sleep diaries underestimated bedtime by 1 hour, overestimated nighttime sleep duration by 2.5 hours, and overestimated 24-hour sleep duration by 2.3 hours, on average for all 3 nights.Conclusion: Mothers reported significantly earlier bedtimes and longer sleep durations for their toddlers compared with actigraphy, suggesting that objective measures differ from sleep diaries in assessing sleep in toddlers from low-income families.

One third (37%) of children had potential sleep problems. Children who shared a bedroom (31%) had shorter sleep onset latencies and those who consumed caffeinated drinks (33%) went to sleep and awoke later. Increased screen time was associated with later bedtimes on school nights and children with screens in bedrooms (12%) went to bed later and slept less on school nights, and had higher Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire scores. Children living with a shift-working adult (27%) slept longer on non-school nights and had shorter sleep onset latencies on school nights.Conclusions: It is important to consider children's sleep within the wider family context and to be aware that parents may over-estimate their children's sleep. Simple strategies to promote sleep health in clinical settings or education programmes include regular weekend bedtimes that align with those on school nights, removing technology from bedrooms and minimising caffeine consumption. An awareness of potential sleep differences associated with shift-working adults may ensure children are supported to have consistent sleep routines that promote adequate sleep.","Biomedical; Blind Peer Reviewed; Editorial Board Reviewed; Expert Peer Reviewed.

Levels of agreement between actigraphy and diary recordings were examined using the Bland and Altman method separately for all recording days, weekdays, and weekends., FINDINGS: Discrepancies between actigraphy-derived and diary-documented sleep onset, sleep offset, actual sleep at night, wake after sleep onset, and daytime sleep were +/-35, +/-15, +/-82, +/-70, and +/-29 min, respectively.

While parental reports tend to overestimate sleep duration, actigraphy boosts the frequency of night-waking's. Our primary goal was to compare actigraphy data and parental reports (Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire, CSHQ), regarding bedtime, wake-up time, sleep duration, and wake after sleep onset (WASO), using the Bland-Altman technique. Forty-six children, age 3-6 years, and their parents participated. Results suggest that, despite existing associations between sleep schedule variables measured by both methods (fromr= 0.57 regarding bedtime at weekends tor= 0.86 regarding wake-up time during the week,ps), differences between them were significant and agreements were weak, with parents overestimating bedtimes and wake-up times in relation to actigraphy. Differences between actigraphy and CSHQ were +/- 52 min for weekly bedtime, +/- 38 min for weekly wake-up time, +/- 159 min for total sleep time, and +/- 62 min for WASO, indicating unsatisfactory agreement between methods. Correlations between actigraphy data and CSHQ dimensions are also explored. Our study contributes to the knowledge of the characteristics of each instrument, along with their tendency to overestimate and underestimate certain sleep parameters.

They were monitored using both methods for 24 hours. Total diurnal and nocturnal sleep times and the numbers of awakenings were evaluated. Actigraph data were analyzed with Sadeh's algorithm., RESULTS: Sleep time was analyzed in 51 infants. The average sleep time was 724.33 (+/-104.69) minutes according to the diaries and 625.18 (+/-109.14) minutes according to the actigraphy data, yielding a difference of 99.16 (+/-97.53) minutes (p<0.0001). The average number of awakenings was 8.65 (+/-3.78) according to the diaries and 13.43 (+/-5.09) according to the actigraphy data, with a difference of -4.78 (+/-4.50) (p<0.0001). A low concordance (<=0.66) was found between the two methods. The two methods provided different results (p<0.05) regarding nocturnal and diurnal sleep. After accounting for differences in disease and feeding types, the actigraphy and diary data were significantly different except for the number of daily awakenings. Concordances were higher in infants with respiratory diseases and those who were breastfed, except for the evaluation of nocturnal sleep., CONCLUSIONS: Concordance between actigraphy and parental reporting is low. Actigraphy may be a useful and easy to use method for collecting data on infants' sleep than a parental diary, but actigraphy data should be analyzed in conjunction with infants' passive movement records.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,Infant,,,,Comparison between actigraphy and parental reporting for sleep assessment in hospitalized infants,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The self-rating sleep questionnaire, OSA, includes five sleep quality factors: sleepiness (F1), sleep maintenance without interruption (F2), worry about daily life or poor emotional condition (F3), integrated or perceived sleep feeling (F4) and sleep initiation or induction (F5). Polygraphic sleep parameters including each sleep stage in minutes were used. If intercorrelation coefficients exceeded 0.8, only one of the related parameters was selected for multivariate analysis. Twelve male students slept a total of 88 nights, among which the first night was not included, in an experimental room. When absolute values of Spearman's rank correlation coefficient of not less than 0.4 were tentatively selected, the following pairs were extracted: F2 score and S1 (-0.423) or S3+S4 (0.409), F5 score and sleep latency (-0.439). Deeper sleep was closely associated with sleep maintenance without interruption. Agreement between self-rating and a polygraphic sleep parameter was recognized between the F5 score and sleep latency. Each OSA factor score was predicted by other polygraphic sleep parameters using multiple regression analysis. MT significantly contributed to the F1, F3 and F4 scores. The number of stage shifts per night significantly contributed to the F1 and F3 scores, and the number of sleep spindles significantly contributed to the F5 score. Though prediction of sleep quality by polygraphic sleep parameters is limited, the association between concrete subjective and objective sleep parameters was clarified as mentioned above, and their practical meaning was partially elucidated.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,adult;affective neurosis;article;clinical article;human;Japan;male;multichannel recorder;self evaluation;*sleep;sleep induction;somnolence;Asian Continental Ancestry Group,,,,Relationship between self-rating and polygraphic sleep parameters - Analysis of compiled data from 12 young Japanese adults,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sleep misperception is the phenomenon in which an individual underestimates the amount of time spent asleep. Little is known about sleep misperception in patients with epilepsy.We conducted retrospective chart reviews on individuals who self-identified as having epilepsy in a questionnaire database of patients undergoing polysomnography (PSG) at the Massachusetts General Hospital Sleep Laboratory. Our metric for sleep misperception was the difference between subjective and objective sleep latency (S-O SL) and subjective and objective total sleep time (S-O TST) with subjective values based on questionnaire and objective values based on PSG.We confirmed 64 patients with epilepsy. We then selected age- and sex-matched diagnostic PSG data for comparison from 50 patients with insomnia symptoms but no obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and another 50 patients with OSA but no insomnia symptoms. In our cohort with epilepsy, the median SL overestimation was 20. min (p. <. 0.05), and the median TST underestimation was 45. min (p. <. 0.05). Sleep misperception was similar regardless of potential confounding factors such as categorical epilepsy refractoriness, cognitive impairment, or psychiatric comorbidity.Our findings suggest that sleep misperception occurs similarly in patients with epilepsy as in patients without epilepsy with insomnia.

Discrepancy between self-report- and actigraphy-measured sleep, often considered an artifact of measurement error, has been well documented among insomnia patients. Sleep problems are common among older adults, and this discrepancy may represent meaningful sleep-related phenomenon, which could have clinical and research significance. Method. Sleep discrepancy was examined in 4 groups of older adults (N = 152, mean age = 71.93 years) based on sleep complaint versus no complaint and presence versus absence of insomnia symptoms. Participants completed the Beck Depression Inventory-second edition (BDI-II) and 14 nights of sleep diaries and actigraphy. Results. Controlling for covariates, group differences were found in the duration and frequency of discrepancy in sleep onset latency (SOLd) and wake after sleep onset (WASOd). Those with insomnia symptoms and complaints reported greater duration and frequency of WASOd than the other 3 groups. Quantities of SOLd and WASOd were related to BDI-II score and group status, indicating that sleep discrepancy has meaningful clinical correlates. Discussion. Discrepancy occurred across all groups but was pronounced among the group with both insomnia symptoms and complaints. This discrepancy may provide a means of quantifying and conceptualizing the transition from wake to sleep among older adults, particularly those with sleeping problems.","Biomedical; Peer Reviewed; USA.

Subtyping ID is an ongoing debate in sleep medicine, but the underlying mechanisms of each subtype is poorly understood. Growing evidence suggests that subcortical brain structures play the key roles in pathophysiology of ID and its subtypes. Here, we aimed to investigate structural alteration of subcortical regions in patients with two common ID subtypes i.e., paradoxical and psychophysiological insomnia. Fifty-five patients and 49 healthy controls were recruited for this study and T1-weighted images and subjective and objective sleep parameters (i.e., Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and polysomnography) were collected from participants. Subcortical structures including the hippocampus, amygdala, caudate, putamen, globus pallidus, nucleus accumbens, and thalamus were automatically segmented in FSL. Volume and shape (using surface vertices) of each structure were compared between the groups, controlled for covariates, and corrected for multiple comparisons. In addition, correlations of sleep parameters and surface vertices or volumes were calculated. The caudate's volume was smaller in patients than controls. Compared with controls, we found regional shrinkage in the caudate, nucleus accumbens, posterior putamen, hippocampus, thalamus, and amygdala in paradoxical insomnia and shrinkage in the amygdala, caudate, hippocampus, and putamen in psychophysiological insomnia. Interestingly, comparing two patients groups, shape alteration in the caudate, putamen, and nucleus accumbens in paradoxical insomnia and shrinkage in the thalamus, amygdala, and hippocampus in psychophysiological insomnia were observed. Both subjective and objective sleep parameters were associated with these regional shape alterations in patients. Our results support the differential role of subcortical brain structures in pathophysiology of paradoxical and psychophysiological insomnia.Â© Copyright Â© 2021 Emamian, Mahdipour, Noori, Rostampour, Mousavi, Khazaie, Khodaie-Ardakani, Tahmasian and Zarei.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,adult;amygdala;article;*brain region;brain size;caudate nucleus;clinical feature;controlled study;female;globus pallidus;gray matter;hippocampus;human;*insomnia/et [Etiology];major clinical study;male;middle aged;nucleus accumbens;pathophysiology;Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index;polysomnography;putamen;sleep efficiency;sleep waking cycle;thalamus;Brain;Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders,,,,Alterations of Subcortical Brain Structures in Paradoxical and Psychophysiological Insomnia Disorder,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Method(s): Polysomnographic (PSG) and neuropsychological data were analysed from 902 community-based Raine Study participants aged 22 +/- 0.6 years of whom 124 met criteria for insomnia (53 with NSDI and 71 with or SSDI) and 246 were classified as healthy with normal sleep (i.e., without insomnia or other sleep disorders). Measurements of self- report (attention and memory) and laboratory-assessed (attention, episodic memory, working memory, learning, and psychomotor function) cognition and mood, and PSG-based sleep stages (% total sleep time; %TST) were compared between these 3 groups. Result(s): In comparison to the healthy sleeper group, both insomnia groups had poorer self-reported attention, memory, mood, and sleep, and poorer laboratory-assessed attention (inconsistency). The NSDI group had less consistent working memory reaction time than healthy-sleepers or those with SSDI. The SSDI group had more inconsistency in executive function (shifting), and showed greater %TST in stage N1 and N3, and less REM sleep than either healthy-sleepers or those with NSDI. Conclusion(s): Individuals with NSDI demonstrated greater working memory inconsistency, despite no laboratory assessed sleep problems, implicating early signs of pathophysiology other than disturbed sleep. Those with SSDI demonstrated different sleep architecture, poorer attention (inconsistency), and greater executive function (inconsistency) compared to healthy-sleepers and those with NSDI, implicating sleep disturbance in the disease process of this phenotype.Â© Copyright Â© 2021 Olaithe, Ree, McArdle, Donaldson, Pushpanathan, Eastwood and Bucks.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,adult;article;*attention;*cognitive defect;controlled study;episodic memory;executive function;female;human;*insomnia;learning;major clinical study;male;mood;*neuropsychology;*phenotype;psychomotor activity;reaction time;*REM sleep;self report;sleep deprivation;sleep time;working memory;young adult;Phenotype;Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders;Cognition,,,,Cognitive Dysfunction in Insomnia Phenotypes: Further Evidence for Different Disorders,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Standard sleep recordings only incompletely reflect subjective aspects of sleep and some individuals with so-called sleep misperception frequently feel awake although sleep recordings indicate clear-cut sleep. To identify the determinants of sleep perception, we performed 787 awakenings in 20 good sleepers and 10 individuals with sleep misperception and interviewed them about their subjective sleep depth while they underwent high-density EEG sleep recordings. Surprisingly, in good sleepers, sleep was subjectively lightest in the first 2 h of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, generally considered the deepest sleep, and deepest in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Compared to good sleepers, sleep misperceptors felt more frequently awake during sleep and reported lighter REM sleep. At the EEG level, spatially widespread high-frequency power was inversely related to subjective sleep depth in NREM sleep in both groups and in REM sleep in misperceptors. Subjective sleep depth positively correlated with dream-like qualities of reports of mental activity. These findings challenge the widely held notion that slow wave sleep best accounts for feeling deeply asleep. Instead, they indicate that subjective sleep depth is inversely related to a neurophysiological process that predominates in early NREM sleep, becomes quiescent in REM sleep, and is reflected in high-frequency EEG activity. In sleep misperceptors, this process is more frequently active, more spatially widespread, and abnormally persists into REM sleep. These findings help identify the neuromodulatory systems involved in subjective sleep depth and are relevant for studies aiming to improve subjective sleep quality.Copyright Â© 2021 Elsevier Inc.

The reflex response by most primary care providers to treat insomnia is by prescribing hypnotics. The most commonly prescribed hypnotic is a sedative, such as a benzodiazepine or a benzodiazepine receptor agonist (BRZA). Paradoxical insomnia is a subtype of insomnia described as a complaint of severe insomnia disproportional to the presence of objective sleep disturbance or daytime impairment. Previously known as sleep-state misperception, this subtype of insomnia is not well known among the primary care community. We present a case of a 60-year-old female who had been prescribed multiple hypnotics for over 10 years and presented to our sleep clinic frustrated due to failure of treatment with each medicine. She was eventually diagnosed with paradoxical insomnia after an evaluation of her sleep parameters. This was effectively treated with cognitive-behavioral therapy. This case report aims to raise awareness of this subtype of insomnia in patients at the primary care level and to help minimize the use of hypnotics.

However, no systematic investigations have been carried out with respect to how the human brain perceives the passage of time during sleep. The brain mechanisms of over- or underestimation of time spent in sleep have not yet been clarified. Here, we carried out an experimental study in which 11 healthy volunteers participated in time estimation trials scheduled six times during 9 h nocturnal sleep periods, under carefully controlled conditions. The time estimation ratio (TER: a ratio of subjective passage of time to actual time interval) decreased significantly from the first to the sixth trial. Individual TER was positively correlated with slow wave sleep prior to the trial, while it was negatively correlated with REM sleep. Our results indicate that the human brain has an ability to estimate the passage of time during nocturnal sleep without referring to time cues, and that the accuracy of this function fluctuates from overestimation in the early hours of sleep to underestimation in the last hours of sleep.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,Adolescent;Adult;Analysis of Variance;*Brain/ph [Physiology];Circadian Rhythm/ph [Physiology];Electroencephalography/mt [Methods];Humans;Male;Polysomnography/mt [Methods];*Sleep/ph [Physiology];*Time Perception/ph [Physiology];Wakefulness/ph [Physiology];Humanities;Humanism,,,,Time estimation during nocturnal sleep in human subjects,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This review focuses on illuminating the puzzling finding that many insomnia patients misperceive their sleep. They overestimate their sleep onset latency (SOL) and underestimate their total sleep time (TST), relative to objective measures. This tendency is ubiquitous (although not universal). Resolving this puzzle has clinical, theoretical, and public health importance. There are implications for assessment, definition, and treatment. Moreover, solving the puzzle creates an opportunity for real-world applications of theories from clinical, perceptual, and social psychology as well as neuroscience. Herein we evaluate 13 possible resolutions to the puzzle. Specifically, we consider the possible contribution, to misperception, of (1) features inherent to the context of sleep (e.g., darkness); (2) the definition of sleep onset, which may lack sensitivity for insomnia patients; (3) insomnia being an exaggerated sleep complaint; (4) psychological distress causing magnification; (5) a deficit in time estimation ability; (6) sleep being misperceived as wake; (7) worry and selective attention toward sleep-related threats; (8) a memory bias influenced by current symptoms and emotions, a confirmation bias/belief bias, or a recall bias linked to the intensity/recency of symptoms; (9) heightened physiological arousal; (10) elevated cortical arousal; (11) the presence of brief awakenings; (12) a fault in neuronal circuitry; and (13) there being 2 insomnia subtypes (one with and one without misperception). The best supported resolutions were misperception of sleep as wake, worry, and brief awakenings. A deficit in time estimation ability was not supported. We conclude by proposing several integrative solutions.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,actimetry;arousal;attention;darkness;human;*insomnia/co [Complication];*mental stress/co [Complication];pathophysiology;*perception disorder;personality test;physiology;polysomnography;psychological aspect;recall;review;*sleep;theoretical model;*time perception;wakefulness;Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders,,,,(Mis)perception of sleep in insomnia: a puzzle and a resolution,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Method(s): In this cross-sectional study over a 2-year period (September 2008 to September 2010), 29 patients with paradoxical insomnia, diagnosed in Kermanshah, Iran by both psychiatric interview and actigraphy, were randomly assigned to 2 groups. For 8 weeks, the first group (n=14) was treated with 10 mg olanzapine daily, and the second group (n=15) was treated with 4 mg risperidone daily. All participants completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Inventory (PSQI) at baseline and at the end of the study. Result(s): As expected, a baseline actigraphy analysis showed that total sleep time was not significantly different between the 2 treatment groups (p<0.3). In both groups, sleep quality was improved (p<0.001) with treatment. When comparing the 2 treatments directions, a significant difference emerged (9.21+/-2.35, 6.07+/-4.46) among the 2 treatment groups based on data from the PSQI. Patients who were treated with olanzapine showed greater improvement than patients who were treated by risperidone (p<0.04).

A 60-year-old woman with chief complaints of insomnia, agitation, and suicidal ideation, was admitted to an inpatient psychiatric ward. Based on information from her family and a mental state examination, her primary diagnosis was sleep state misperception. She was treated with Trazodone. Because she was unresponsive to the treatment, a full psychiatric evaluation and wrist actigraphy report were undertaken, resulting in a revised diagnosis of delusional disorder. She was started on Olanzapine and, after 6 weeks was discharged with good improvement. Sleep state misperception might be considered not just as a sleep disorder, but also as a psychiatric disorder with psychotic symptoms. Further research is recommended.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,"actimetry;adult;agitation;article;case report;delusional disorder/co [Complication];delusional disorder/di [Diagnosis];delusional disorder/dt [Drug Therapy];drug treatment failure;electroconvulsive therapy;female;human;*insomnia/co [Complication];*insomnia/di [Diagnosis];*insomnia/dt [Drug Therapy];insomnia/dt [Drug Therapy];patient assessment;psychologic test;suicidal ideation;treatment response;amitriptyline/dt [Drug Therapy];*olanzapine/dt [Drug Therapy];thioridazine/dt [Drug Therapy];trazodone/dt [Drug Therapy];Sleep Disorders, Intrinsic;Psychotic Disorders",,,,Insomnia treatment by Olanzapine: Is sleep state misperception a psychotic disorder?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Participants were evaluated for subjective and objective sleep using sleep diary and polysomnography. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was conducted during the presentation of insomnia-related (Ins), general anxiety-inducing (Gen), and neutral (Neu) stimuli. Brain reactivity to the contrast of Ins vs. Neu and Gen vs. Neu was compared among the SODS (n = 13), NOSODS (n = 15), and HC (n = 16) groups. In the SODS group compared to other groups, brain areas including the left fusiform, bilateral precuneus, right superior frontal gyrus, genu of corpus callosum, and bilateral anterior corona radiata showed significantly increased blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal in the contrast of Ins vs. Neu. There was no brain region with significantly increased BOLD signal in the Gen vs. Neu contrast in the group comparisons. Increased brain activity to insomnia-related stimuli in several brain regions of the SODS group is likely due to these individuals being more sensitive to sleep-related threat and negative cognitive distortion toward insomnia.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,Adult;Aged;Brain/dg [Diagnostic Imaging];*Brain/ph [Physiology];Female;Humans;*Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;Middle Aged;Oxygen/bl [Blood];Polysomnography;Severity of Illness Index;*Sleep/ph [Physiology];Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders/dg [Diagnostic Imaging];*Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders/pp [Physiopathology];Young Adult;Brain;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders,,,,Brain reactivity using fMRI to insomnia stimuli in insomnia patients with discrepancy between subjective and objective sleep,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sleep state misperception was defined objectively as a TST of at least 6.5 h and an objective sleep efficiency (SE) of at least 85%., RESULTS: The prevalence of sleep-state misperception in primary insomniacs was 26.4%. The (low) quality of sleep and psychiatric parameters were similar in the two groups, although the objective sleep architecture was relatively normal for the misperception group. Multivariate analysis revealed that both SE and sleep quality were significant factors associated with subjective TST in the misperception group, while only SE was significant in those without misperception. Subjective TST was a significant effect factor with respect to sleep quality in the misperception group, while the Beck Depression Inventory-2 score and age were significant factors in those without misperception., CONCLUSIONS: The clinical characteristics of patients with sleep-state misperception differed from those without this condition.

However, findings in BPD are not unequivocal for REM dysregulation, as well as for a decrement of slow wave sleep and sleep continuity disturbances. Earlier findings in sleep EEG abnormalities in BPD may have been confounded by concomitant depressive symptoms. Method(s): Twenty unmedicated female BPD patients without current comorbid major depression and 20 sex- and age-matched control subjects entered the study. Conventional polysomnographic parameters and for the first time sleep EEG spectral power analysis was performed on two sleep laboratory nights. Subjective sleep parameters were collected by sleep questionnaires in order to assess the relationship between objective and subjective sleep measurements. Result(s): BPD patients showed a tendency for shortened REM latency and significantly decreased NonREM sleep (stage 2). Spectral EEG analysis showed increased delta power in total NREM sleep as well as in REM sleep in BPD patients. Subjective ratings documented drastically impaired sleep quality in BPD patients for the two weeks before the study and during the two laboratory nights. Conclusion(s): Not-depressed BPD patients only showed tendencies for depression-like REM sleep abnormalities. Surprisingly, BPD patients displayed higher levels of delta power in the sleep EEG in NREM sleep than healthy control subjects. There was a marked discrepancy between objective and subjective sleep measurements, which indicates an altered perception of sleep in BPD. The underlying psychological and neurobiological mechanisms of these alterations are still unclear and need to be clarified in future studies including interventions on a pharmacological and cognitive-behavioral level.

Subjective evaluation of sleep included the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the sleep questionnaire for HD (HDQ), the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, the Bologna questionnaire for sleepiness (BQ), the Berlin questionnaire, and the RBD questionnaire; the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group scale was administered to patients with positive screening. The psychometric evaluation included the Zung Anxiety Scale, the short form of the Beck Depression Inventory, and the Maudsley Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory. All patients underwent V-PSG., RESULTS: In sleepiness evaluation, the Epworth score was above the cutoff in 6 subjects, and the BQ detected a ""high risk"" of sleepiness in 7 cases. The results were concordant in 24 and discordant in 5 cases. In the evaluation of sleep quality, the PSQI score was above the cutoff in 18 subjects. According to the HDQ, 10 subjects were poor sleepers. The results were concordant with the PSQI in 20 subjects., DISCUSSION: All comparisons between scale scores and PSG results showed poor or totally absent concordance between subjective and objective measures., SIGNIFICANCE: The subjective evaluation of sleep in HD patients shows a poor correlation with PSG results.

In the present study, we evaluated subjective sleep problems in AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) with self-check questionnaires and objective sleep problems with a convenient home-based portable device, WatchPAT. A total of 63 subjects with normal cognition (NC) (n = 22), MCI (n = 20), and AD (n = 21) were cross-sectionally investigated. AD patients showed a better self-check Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) score (*p < 0.05) than NC and MCI patients. On the other hand, WatchPAT analysis showed a significantly reduced rapid eye movement (REM) sleep (*p < 0.05) and increased light sleep in AD patients (*p < 0.05) compared with NC subjects, and mildly reduced REM and increased light sleep in MCI subjects. The present study revealed a gap between the subjective self-check sleep questions and the objective WatchPAT analysis in AD patients. Thus, a home-based sleep study with WatchPAT is a useful tool to detect an objective sleep problem in AD and the risk of MCI conversion into AD.Copyright Â© 2020 Elsevier Ltd","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,aged;*Alzheimer disease;apnea hypopnea index;article;clinical article;cognition;controlled study;cross-sectional study;female;human;male;*mild cognitive impairment;nonREM sleep;Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index;priority journal;questionnaire;REM sleep;risk assessment;*sleep disorder;sleep latency;sleep time;*home use apnea monitor;Alzheimer Disease;Sleep,,,,Discrepancy of subjective and objective sleep problems in Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment detected by a home-based sleep analysis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, apart from evaluating electrophysiologically defined states as 'sleep' or as 'wakefulness' after having been awakened in the night, subjects answered questions about different aspects of subjective experience that might be connected with state perception. During a single night in the sleep laboratory, 22 young subjects without sleep, complaints were woken up by a buzzer four times and had to answer a standardized set of questions. Awakenings were made in randomized order in the stages awake, stage 2 (one short and one long stage 2 phase) and REM sleep. The questions were related to judgment of the state, mental activity and perceptual aspects. In the analysis, it was examined whether the subjective experience differed, on the one hand, between the awakening conditions and, on the other hand, between the subjects' judgements of 'sleep' or 'wakefulness'. Judgments of sleep were given most often after awakenings from REM sleep. In stage 2 sleep, they were more frequent after a longer than after a shorter sleep duration. Aspects of subjective experience showed characteristic differences between the awakening conditions, with the greatest disparity between wakefulness and REM sleep. Furthermore, there was a correlation between the frequency of 'sleep' judgements and the items 'image-like mental content', 'failure of control over mental content', 'failure to perceive the environment' and 'awareness of the transition between sleep and wakefulness'. Despite the exploratory character of the study, the results indicate that there are connections between the perception of sleep and certain aspects of subjective experience. This relationship is the basis for a proposed continuity hypothesis of state perception which says that physiological sleep will be perceived as wakefulness if the mental processes are congruent in both states, and as sleep if the mental processes differ between the states.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,*arousal;article;human;human experiment;mental performance;nonREM sleep;perception;polysomnography;REM sleep;self report;*sleep,,,,Self reports after wakening - A contribution to sleep perception,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Inter hemispheric EEG coherence between central electrode pairs are compared to each other within these groups. A linear measure called as Coherence Function (CF) and a nonlinear measure called as Mutual Information (MI) are performed by using the Information Theory Toolbox in the present sleep EEG synchronization study. Regarding as tests, for all-night EEG recordings of participants, both measures indicate higher degree of EEG coherence for insomnia than for controls. The results further validate inter-hemispheric CF as a sign of activity in insomnia where the EEG series from stage2, REM sleep and the eyes closed waking state. In particular, the CF is found to be more useful tool than the MI for detection of insomnia when the power spectral density estimations of sleep stages are provided by the Burg Method. In conclusion, the CF provides insights into functional connectivity of brain regions during sleep. Since the CF has a characteristic shape for sleep states, it can be proposed to identify the degree of EEG complexity depending on sleep disorders.

The mean age of the studied group was 43+/-1.5 years and males comprised 53.7%. In the whole group, sleep onset latency was 42.6+/-7.74 minutes, sleep efficiency 69.9+/-2.5 and arousal index was 18.8+/-1.8 per hour. Presumptive polysomnographic diagnoses were identified in 56 patients (83.6%). Sleep state misperception (SSM) represented 40.3% of the studied insomniacs and sleep disordered breathing (SDB) was detected in 25.4%. The present study illustrated the importance of PSG in the assessment of selected patients with chronic insomnia. It also demonstrated that high percentage of insomniacs have subjective insomnia. Finally, the prevalence of SDB is common among patients with chronic insomnia.

The extent of misperception varies between different types of INS. The following paper comprised sections which will be aimed at studying the sleep EEG and compares it to subjective reports of sleep in individuals suffering from either psychophysiological insomnia or paradoxical insomnia and good sleeper controls. The EEG can be studied without any intervention (thus using the raw data) via either PSG or fine quantitative EEG analyses (power spectral analysis [PSA]), identifying EEG patterns as in the case of cyclic alternating patterns (CAPs) or by decorticating the EEG while scoring the different transient or phasic events (K-Complexes or sleep spindles). One can also act on the on-going EEG by delivering stimuli so to study their impact on cortical measures as in the case of event-related potential studies (ERPs). From the paucity of studies available using these different techniques, a general conclusion can be reached: sleep misperception is not an easy phenomenon to quantify and its clinical value is not well recognized. Still, while none of the techniques or EEG measures defined in the paper is available and/or recommended to diagnose insomnia, ERPs might be the most indicated technique to study hyperarousal and sleep quality in different types of INS. More research shall also be dedicated to EEG patterns and transient phasic events as these EEG scoring techniques can offer a unique insight of sleep misperception.Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,analytic method;arousal;electroencephalography;electromyography;electrooculography;event related potential;Fourier transformation;human;image analysis;*insomnia/di [Diagnosis];polysomnography;quantitative analysis;REM sleep;review;*sleep disorder/di [Diagnosis];sleep quality;sleep spindle;sleep time;paradoxical insomnia/di [Diagnosis];power spectral analysis;psychophysiological insomnia/di [Diagnosis];*sleep misperception/di [Diagnosis];Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders,,,,Insomnia and sleep misperception,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Detection strategies such as polysomnography, actigraphy, and subjective reports have been utilised to assess paediatric sleep patterns such as sleep duration, and problems in both clinical and non-clinical samples. Although objective assessments have more validity in assessing and diagnosing sleep disorders, subjective sleep reports are commonly used for screening sleep patterns and disturbance in large scale community studies. In the past few years several studies have studies explored the accuracy of subjective measures in estimation of sleep duration by comparing them with objective measures. This review examined and evaluated the paediatric literature dating from 1992 comparing subjective sleep measures (sleep diaries and/or questionnaires) to objective measures (PSG and/or actigraphy) of sleep duration. These studies suggest subjective sleep reports are valid for screening, but are less consistent in estimating sleep pattern variables such as sleep duration, night wakings, and sleep onset latency. Understanding the congruence between subjective and objective measures in large studies may advance understanding of the validity of subjective sleep measures, an important factor given the integral role of self-report in large scale community research and the negative daytime sequelae associated with reduced sleep.

Specifically, it was found that insomniacs display increased tension/confusion, decreased vigor, personality disturbance, subjective over-estimation of poor sleep, increased body temperature, increased 24-hour whole body metabolic rate, and increased multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) values. Normal sleepers given the nocturnal EEG parameters of insomniacs displayed decreased tension, decreased vigor, decreased body temperature, and decreased MSLT values. The spectrum of changes seen in the normal sleepers given an insomniac sleep pattern was characteristic of mild partial sleep deprivation and not consistent with symptoms found in patients with primary insomnia. It was concluded that the secondary symptoms reported by patients with primary insomnia are probably not related to their poor sleep per se. Data from previous studies that varied physiological arousal were used to support the contention that the secondary symptoms of insomnia, including poor sleep, occur secondary to central nervous system hyperarousal.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,Adult;Analysis of Variance;Female;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Polysomnography;Psychomotor Performance/ph [Physiology];Sleep/ph [Physiology];*Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders/pp [Physiopathology];Time Factors;Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders,,,,The consequences of a week of insomnia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was hypothesized that Sleep State Misperception insomnia, like psychophysiological insomnia, could be associated with increased physiological activation, here indexed by whole body metabolic rate.Method: Groups of nine patients with Sleep State Misperception insomnia and age-, sex-, and weight-matched normal sleepers were evaluated on sleep, performance, mood, personality, and metabolic measures over a 36-hour sleep laboratory stay.Results: Sleep State Misperception insomniacs had a subjective history of poor sleep and perceived their laboratory sleep as poor but had electroencephalogram (EEG) parameters that did not differ statistically from matched normal controls. Sleep State Misperception insomniacs had abnormal MMPI values and were subjectively more confused, tense, depressed, and angry than matched normals. Sleep State Misperception insomniacs also had a significantly increased 24-hour metabolic rate, compared with matched normals.Conclusions: The overall increase in whole body oxygen use was less than that seen in psychophysiological insomniacs but was consistent with the view that Sleep State Misperception insomnia may be a mild version or a precursor to psychophysiological insomnia.","research.

The stress and coping framework of Lazarus and Folkman guided this study. A descriptive correlational design was used for this 10-week pilot study. Ten adult family caregivers of patients with cancer were recruited from outpatient oncology clinics. Sleep quality and depression were measured weekly. Actigraphs were worn for 72 hours during weeks 1, 5, and 10. Individual sleep quality and depression scores were generated. Actigraph latency, duration, and efficiency scores were generated. Actigraph and sleep quality scores were compared. Individual caregiver sleep and depression plots show large variance over time. Discrepancies were noted between Actigraph and sleep quality latency, duration, and efficiency scores. Sleep and depressive symptoms fluctuate widely over time. Therefore, accurate assessment and treatment of caregiver problems require repeated assessments. Self-reports of sleep and depression appear to underestimate problems and must be evaluated carefully within this context.","research; tables/charts.

As far as we know, only two studies used polysomnography (PSG), the gold standard for the diagnosis of SD. This is the first study assessing SD in children with chronic kidney disease (CKD) on APD in our country.Methods: This was an observational and descriptive study. Children up to 18 years of age who had undergone APD for a minimum of three months were considered eligible. Exclusion criteria were diabetes, neurologic disorders and sedative/hypnotic therapy. PSG was performed while the children were on their usual cycler nocturnal dialysis regimen. A questionnaire was completed on the same day. Informed, written consent was provided by all participants.Results: Eight children on APD were studied. The median age was 10 years (range, 1-18 years) and the mean body mass index z-score wasÂ -0.35 (Â±0.71). The average duration on dialysis was 8.4 months. SD was noted in five (62.5%) patients. The results of PSG showed decreased sleep efficiency (81.05Â Â±Â 0.09%) and latency (13.6Â Â±Â 11.6Â min), increased awake time (23.08% of total sleep time (TST)Â Â±Â 14.3), apnea/hypopnea index (1.8/hÂ Â±Â 1.9) and desaturation index (4.5Â Â±Â 3.7). Periodic leg movements index average was normal (0.78/hÂ Â±Â 0.77). Subjective data obtained by the sleep questionnaire underestimated PSG findings.Conclusion: Our study shows that SD was present in more than half of children on PD. This result, in a small sample of patients, alerts to the need for systematic screening for sleep problems in children with CKD with a low threshold for a formal PSG.","research.

All insomniacs evaluated at the Dartmouth Sleep Disorders Center between 1975 and 1980 were studied if they met specific criteria (n=89). First night effects were assessed using the following four variables: sleep efficiency, sleep latency, percentage of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and REM latency. The 20 subjects who showed the strongest normal FNE were compared with the 20 showing the strongest reverse FNE. The two groups were similar in age, sex, and most aspects of reported home sleep. They differed in their sleep on night 1, but on nights 2 and 3 their sleep was quite similar. Both groups overestimated their sleep latencies on night 1 (by subjective reports) but unlike the normal FNE group, the reverse FNE patients very accurately assessed their sleep latency on nights 2 and 3. Reverse FNE patients had significantly higher scores than normal FNE patients on the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) K (defensiveness, guardedness) and Pa (paranoia) scales, and they were less depressed, marginally less anxious, and somewhat more sensation-seeking and more susceptible to boredom. This study concluded that evaluations using only 1 night in the laboratory may be missing the larger picture of a patient's insomnia. When data from only 1 laboratory night are available for an insomniac, care should be taken with the label of 'subjective complaint without objective findings' in patients who are defensive, guarded, and sensation-seeking.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,human;*insomnia;major clinical study;methodology;priority journal;*REM sleep;Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders,,,,Reverse first night effect in insomnia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We aimed to examine sleep quality in hospitalized patients with advanced cancer by combining patient-reported outcome-measures (PROMs) and polysomnography (PSG) or actigraphy.Methods: A one-night prospective observational study of sleep in hospitalized patients with metastatic cancer using WHO step III opioids was conducted. Total sleep time, sleep onset latency, number of awakenings, and wake after sleep onset were assessed by PROMs and actigraphy. Sleep quality was assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) (range; 0-21), where higher scores indicate worse sleep quality.Results: Forty patients were monitored. Median age was 70, median oral morphine equivalent dose was 80Â mg/24Â h (10-1725), median Karnofsky Performance Score was 50 (20-90), and median time to death from inclusion was 38Â days (4-319).

Patients and Methods: A cross-sectional case-control study was conducted in patients with Para-I (n=63), patients with Psy-I (n=63), and NS (n=63) from southwest China. The three groups were matched for age (mean age: 42.0+/-10.30 years), gender (per group: male =22; female =41), educational level, and nature of occupation. Anxiety and depression were evaluated using the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale and Self-Rating Depression Scale and compared among the groups. Result(s): Concerning anxiety, patients with Para-I had a significantly higher mean Self-Rating Anxiety Scale score (P<0.05) and significantly higher incidence of anxiety compared to NS (P<0.0167). There were no significant differences between the two insomnia groups on anxiety measures. Concerning depression, patients with Para-I had a significantly higher mean Self-Rating Depression Scale score than patients with Psy-I and NS (both, P<0.05), as well as a significantly higher incidence of moderate to severe depression than in the Psy-I group and NS (both, P<0.0167). Conclusion(s): Both Psy-I and Para-I patients had significantly higher anxiety and depression than NS. Compared to Psy-I, Para-I patients had slightly (but not significantly) lower anxiety and significantly higher depression.Copyright Â© 2018 Liao et al.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,adult;aged;*anxiety;article;case control study;China;controlled study;cross-sectional study;*depression;disease association;disease severity;educational status;female;human;incidence;*insomnia;major clinical study;male;occupation;Self-rating Anxiety Scale;Self-rating Depression Scale;sleep;sleep latency;sleep time;wakefulness;Case-Control Studies;Anxiety;Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders,,,,Anxiety and depression in paradoxical insomnia: A case-control study,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Design(s): Cross-sectional comparisons of GS, PSY-I and PARA-I. Setting(s): Participants slept for 4 consecutive nights in the laboratory where PSG was recorded. Nights 2 and 3 were combined to compare REM sleep between groups. Participant(s): Thirty-nine PSY-I, 27 PARA-I and 47 GS completed the study, comprising home questionnaires, clinical interviews and night PSG recordings. All participants were aged between 25 and 55 and met inclusion criteria for either PSY-I, PARA-I or GS. Intervention(s): N/A. Measurements and results: Results showed no between group differences on REM sleep macrostructure. As for REM sleep microstructure, PSY-I had an increased number of wake intrusions compared to PARA-I (p = .03). Subjective SE, TST and TWT were significantly correlated with the duration of REM sleep (REMD; p <= .002) and with the proportion of REM sleep for PARA-I (p. <= .06). Conclusion(s): REM sleep macrostructure does not seem to be an adequate indicator of hyperarousal in insomnia. However, the number of wake intrusions in REM could be used to differentiate PSY-I from PARA-I and could reflect the heightened arousal of the former group. Relationships between REM sleep duration and proportion could be linked to dream imagery activity, especially in PARA-I. Further investigations are needed to identify variables that could reflect hyperarousal and differentiate insomnia types.Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,"adult;*arousal;article;comparative study;cross-sectional study;female;human;*insomnia;major clinical study;male;*REM sleep;sleep quality;sleep time;wakefulness;Sleep, REM;Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders",,,,REM sleep as a potential indicator of hyperarousal in psychophysiological and paradoxical insomnia sufferers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous findings suggest that personality profiles of patients with PARA-I may be different from other subtypes of insomnia. Therefore, investigation of these profiles can be helpful in the clinical management of these patients. Objective(s): The current study compares personality profiles of individuals with paradoxical insomnia (PARA-I), psycho-physiological insomnia (PSY-I), and normal sleepers (NS). Material(s) and Method(s): A cross-sectional case-control study was conducted in the Sleep Disorders Research Center of Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, Iran between 2015 and 2017. Patients with PARA-I (n=20), PSY-I (n=20), and NS (n=60) were matched for age, gender, education, and history of mental and/or physical illness and completed the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) short form. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the Kruskal-Wallis test were used to compare subscale means across groups. Result(s): With the exception of the schizophrenia scale (P =.059), significant differences were found in all subscales of the insomnia groups compared to the NS group (P=.001). Compared to the NS group, patients with PARA-I showed significant differences in the hysteria and hypomania subscales (P<.05) and patients with PSY-I showed significant differences in the hysteria, hypochondriasis, and psychopathic subscales (P=.001). No significant differences were found between the PARA-I and PSY-I groups on any subscale. Conclusion(s): This study demonstrates that significant differences in the personality profiles on the MMPI exist between PARA-I and PSY-I patients compared to NS. These findings should inform the diagnosis and future treatment approaches for insomnia.Copyright Â© 2020 Brazilian Association of Sleep and Latin American Federation of Sleep Societies.

To this end, 15 healthy volunteers (6 males; mean age 37.20 +/- 17.55 years) every morning, for at least 7 consecutive days, filled both paper and electronic sleep diary. Furthermore, sleep was objectively assessed through actigraphy. With reference to all sleep parameters examined, no significant differences were observed between paper and electronic sleep diary. As expected, paper and electronic sleep diary showed the same poor agreement with actigraphic estimates of sleep quantity and sleep quality. On the basis of the present data, we can conclude that electronic sleep diary performs like paper sleep diary. Bearing in mind that electronic sleep diary presents several benefits in comparison to the paper sleep diary (e.g. avoiding of the ""parking lot syndrome"", in which patient retrospectively completes more days at the same time; reducing the time for data entry and scoring), we suggest that, if the present findings will be confirmed also in clinical populations, electronic sleep diary should replace paper sleep diary in both research and clinical settings.Copyright Â© 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,actimetry;adult;clinical article;concurrent validity;consensus;controlled study;female;human;male;*sleep quality;tablet;volunteer;Sleep,,,,Comparison between paper and electronic sleep diary,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lately, finer measures, such as event-related potentials, and especially the N1 and P2 components have been used to document arousal processes in individuals with insomnia. The objective of the present study was to further circumscribe arousal in Psy-I and Para-I using N1, P2 and the waking processing negativity (wPN). N1 and P2 were recorded in the evening, at sleep-onset and in early stage 2 sleep in 26 good sleepers, 26 Psy-I and 26 Para-I. An oddball paradigm was used and participants received the instruction to ignore all stimuli at all times. Three difference waves (wPNs) were computed to evaluate the transition from wakefulness to sleep onset, from sleep onset to sleep and from wakefulness to sleep. Results revealed that N1 was smaller during wakefulness and sleep onset for Psy-I, while it was larger for Para-I during these same times. P2 was smaller at sleep onset for Psy-I than for Para-I and GS, while P2 during wakefulness and stage 2 sleep was larger for Para-I than GS. WPNs revealed that Psy-I showed fewer changes in information processing, while Para-I showed larger changes between recording times. Psy-I appear to present an inability to inhibit information processing during sleep onset, while Para-I seem to present overall enhanced attentional processing that results in a greater need for inhibition.

Setting(s): Academic medical center. Patients or Participants: Twenty-two pairs of monozygotic twins where 1 member of the pair had CFS and the other did not. Intervention(s): N/A Measurements and Results: Twenty-two CFS-discordant twin pairs completed a Sleep Disorders Questionnaire, overnight polysomnography, and a postpolysomnography sleep survey. Mean and percent differences in the sleep measures were compared between the CFS and healthy twins using matched-pair methods of analysis. Compared with their healthy co-twins, the CFS twins more frequently endorsed 8 subjective measures of insomnia and poor sleep (all p <= 0.05). However, the CFS and healthy twins did not differ in objective polysomnographic measures of insomnia, including sleep latency, total sleep time, sleep efficiency, arousal number, arousal index, hypnogram awakenings, rapid eye movement (REM)-sleep latency, and percent stages 1, 2, and 3-4 (delta). Percent stage REM sleep was increased in the CFS twins compared with the healthy twins (27.7% vs. 24.4%, p <= 0.05). On the postpolysomnography survey, CFS twins reported that they had slept fewer hours (6.2 vs. 6.7; p <= 0.05), and were less well rested (p <= 0.001) compared to their co-twins. Conclusion(s): CFS patients had worse subjective sleep than their co-twins despite little objective data supporting this discrepancy, suggesting they suffer from an element of sleep-state misperception. The higher percentage of REM sleep in the CFS twins implies that REM sleep may play a role in this illness.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,"arousal;article;*chronic fatigue syndrome;controlled study;human;*insomnia;measurement;monozygotic twins;polysomnography;priority journal;questionnaire;REM sleep;rest;sleep;sleep disorder;sleep time;twin discordance;university hospital;Fatigue Syndrome, Chronic;Twins;Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders",,,,Comparison of subjective and objective measures of insomnia in monozygotic twins discordant for chronic fatigue syndrome,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it is not known if subjective insomnia symptoms are associated with objective parameters of sleep architecture. Thus, we analyze the association between sleep macrostructure and EEG activity versus insomnia symptoms among kTx recipients.Methods: Participants (n1=100) were selected from prevalent adult transplant recipients (n0=1214) followed at a single institution. Insomnia symptoms were assessed by the Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS) and standard overnight polysomnography was performed. In a subgroup of patients (n2=56) sleep microstructure was also analyzed with power spectral analysis.Results: In univariable analysis AIS score was not associated with sleep macrostructure parameters (sleep latency, total sleep time, slow wave sleep, wake after sleep onset), nor with NREM and REM beta or delta activity in sleep microstructure. In multivariable analysis after controlling for covariables AIS score was independently associated with the proportion of slow wave sleep (Î²=0.263; CI: 0.026-0.500) and REM beta activity (Î²=0.323; CI=0.041-0.606) (p<0.05 for both associations).Conclusions: Among kTx recipients the severity of insomnia symptoms is independently associated with higher proportion of slow wave sleep and increased beta activity during REM sleep but not with other parameters sleep architecture. The results suggest a potential compensatory sleep protective mechanism and a sign of REM sleep instability associated with insomnia symptoms among this population.","research.

We aimed to investigate the link between sleep spindles and microstructural architecture of sleep in regard to psychiatric characteristics in paradoxical insomnia. Method(s): A total of 40 participants (20 with paradoxical insomnia, 20 healthy controls) were included in the study. All participants were evaluated by somnologists and undergone a full-night polysomnography at sleep laboratory. In addition, psychiatric interview was made by the same psychiatrist, and questionnaires were performed to assess the dimensions of the personality such as the neuroticism or extroversion (Eysenck Personality Questionnaire, EPQR-A); to evaluate the tendency to exaggerate somatic perceptions (Somatosensory Amplification Scale, SSAS), somatic parts of dissociation (Somatoform Dissociation Questionnaire, SDQ-20), and somatization (Somatization Scale, SS); to measure participants' feelings about their health and disease anxiety (Health Anxiety Inventory, HAI-18), and the level of uncontrollable and persistent anxiety (Penn State Worry Questionnaire, PSWQ); to investigate the tendency to ruminative thinking (Ruminative Thought Style Questionnaire, RTSQ), alexithymia (Toronto Alexithymia Scale, TAS-20); and to define the presence and the severity of depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory, BDI). Result(s): The duration and frequency of the sleep spindles were similar between two groups, while the density was significantly decreased in paradoxical insomnia. The duration of sleep spindles, on the other hand, showed positive correlations with the extroversion dimension scores of EPQR-A and PSWQ scores. Discussion(s): Sleep protective mechanisms are disturbed in paradoxical insomnia as shown by the lower density of sleep spindles. In addition, fast spindle activity is associated with the personality traits, characterized by an increase in the expression of feelings and the level of anxiety.Copyright Â© 2021 Elsevier B.V.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,adult;alexithymia;anxiety;article;Beck Depression Inventory;clinical article;cognitive rumination;controlled study;depression;dissociation;extraversion;Eysenck Personality Questionnaire;female;Health Anxiety Inventory;human;*insomnia;interview;male;neurosis;night;Penn State Worry Questionnaire;*polysomnography;psychiatrist;questionnaire;*sleep spindle;somatization;Somatosensory Amplification Scale;Toronto Alexithymia scale;Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders;Sleep,,,,Changes in sleep structure and sleep spindles are associated with the neuropsychiatric profile in paradoxical insomnia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Overall, the patients overestimated the duration of sleep and, to a lesser degree, the time they awaken in the morning. The number and duration of waking periods in the night were regularly underestimated, and no correlation could be found between the estimated number of waking periods and those actually recorded on the EEG. The composition of sleep on falling asleep and on waking, when these are overestimated, showed an appreciable period of waking sleep at these times (21% and 41%, respectively). The authors suggest that their results indicate that the study of the transitional periods of sleep and waking may provide a better understanding of insomnia and lead to alternative therapeutic approaches. They also indicate that the shorter duration of sleep is only one aspect of insomnia and other factors are probably important.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,adult;central nervous system;*electroencephalography;*insomnia;major clinical study;*sleep;Electroencephalography;Wakefulness,,,,Comparison of the waking EEG with the subjective impression of the waking individual,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Method(s): Twenty-one subjects were studied. Subjects with sleep state misperception (N=7) had insomnia complaints for more than 1 year, no objective sleep disturbance, and sleep efficiency of 90% or greater (on the diagnostic screening sleep recording), while subjectively estimating that sleep time was less than 6.5 hours. Subjects with objective insomnia (N=7) met the same subjective criteria, but objectively sleep efficiency was 85% or less. Normal subjects (N=7) had no insomnia complaints and objective sleep efficiency of 90% or greater. All subjects were recorded on 2 consecutive nights three times with a 3-week period between each pair of nights (6 standard all-night polysomnographic sessions of 8 hours). A subjective sleep questionnaire was administered after each sleep recording night. Result(s): Sleep stage variables (percentages) were similar between the two insomnia groups, and both were different from the normal subjects. Sleep continuity variables were disturbed in the objective insomnia group, but they were similar in the sleep state misperception and normal groups. Both insomnia groups rated their sleep as inadequate on the questionnaires and differed from the normal subjects. The distinct sleep patterns of each of the three groups did not vary over the 6 nights of assessment.

Material(s) and Method(s): All patients admitted to our sleep disorders unit during the year 2019, and diagnosed as having paradoxical insomnia were prospectively included. Upon evaluation of clinical and polysomnographic data, the patients with paradoxical insomnia without comorbid sleep disorders were clas-sified as Group 1, and those with comorbid sleep disorders were clas-sified as Group 2. Result(s): Out of 32 patients having paradoxical insomnia, only 10 (31.3%) patients had no accompanying sleep disor-ders. Twenty two patients had comorbid sleep disorders (Group 2, 68.7%), and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) was the most common comorbidity (59.4%). In Group 1, 80% were females; while in Group 2, 63.6% were males (p=0.054). Comorbid psychiatric disorders were more frequent in Group 1, although it was not significant (30% vs 18.2%; p=0.648). Among Group 2, the subjective-objective mismatch was found to be significantly more pronounced in patients with moderate to severe OSAS in compared to those with mild OSAS. Conclusion(s): We observed that comorbid sleep disorders are common in paradoxical insomnia. In the evaluation of sleep misperception, the subjective-objective mismatch was not predictive to differentiate patients with paradoxical insomnia with or without comorbid sleep dis-orders. On the other hand, OSAS associated with paradoxical insomnia may result in greater subjective-objective mismatch. It may therefore be logical to suggest routine polysomnographic investigation in all patients with paradoxical insomnia.Copyright Â© 2022 by Turkiye Klinikleri.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,adult;article;case control study;clinical article;*clinical evaluation;*comorbidity;controlled study;cross-sectional study;female;human;*insomnia/di [Diagnosis];male;mental disease/di [Diagnosis];*polysomnography;prospective study;retrospective study;*sleep disorder/di [Diagnosis];*sleep disordered breathing/di [Diagnosis];polysomnograph;Case-Control Studies;Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders,,,,Correlation of Clinical and Polysomnographic Data in Paradoxical Insomnia: Case-Control Study,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to determine the clinical and polysomnographic characteristics associated with EQS and EDS assessed objectively during extended polysomnography recording. Method(s): A total of 266 drug-free subjects (201 women; mean age: 26.5 years [16.08; 60.87]) underwent 32-h bed-rest polysomnography recording preceded by polysomnography and modified multiple sleep latency test (mMSLT). Participants were categorized according to their total sleep time (bed-rest TST >=19 h, hypersomnia), objective EDS (mean sleep latency on MSLT <=8 min), and self-reported EDS (Epworth sleepiness scale score >10) and EQS (>=9 h/24 h per week). Result(s): Subjects with hypersomnia were often younger, with normal sleep architecture, high nighttime sleep efficiency, and severe objective EDS. No association with sex, body mass index, Epworth sleepiness scale, EQS, and depressive symptoms was detected. Subjects with objective EDS had less EQS, higher sleep efficiency, and increased hypersomnia. Discrepancies were observed between objective and self-reported measures of sleep duration and EDS. Finally, 71 subjects were identified who had objective hypersomnia and/or EDS, no medical and psychiatric conditions and normal polysomnography parameters, and therefore met the stringent criteria of idiopathic hypersomnia, an orphan disorder. Conclusion(s): Sleep duration and EDS should be quantified using self-reported and objective measures in a controlled procedure to differentiate long sleepers, patients with hypersomnia, and patients with idiopathic hypersomnia. This will help to better understand their biology, to identify specific biomarkers, and to assess related health outcomes.Copyright Â© 2020 Sleep Research Society.

Participants were 96 young people (40 with BPD features, 38 healthy individuals, and 18 young people seeking help for mental health difficulties without BPD). Sleep was measured subjectively (self-report questionnaires) and objectively (10 days of actigraphy). Young people with BPD features reported poorer subjective sleep quality, greater insomnia symptoms and later chronotype than same-age healthy and clinical comparison groups. Young people with BPD features also displayed irregular sleep timing, later rise times, greater time in bed and longer sleep durations than healthy young people. Those with BPD features had superior sleep quality (greater sleep efficiency, less wake after sleep onset) and longer sleep durations than the clinical comparison group. Sleep profiles were similar across young people with BPD features with and without co-occurring depression. Overall, the findings revealed a subjective-objective sleep discrepancy and suggest that sleep-improvement interventions might be beneficial to improve subjective sleep in young people with BPD features.Copyright Â© 2021 European Sleep Research Society","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,accelerometry;actimetry;acute stress disorder;adolescent;adult;agoraphobia;alcohol consumption;article;automutilation;bedtime;binge eating disorder;*borderline state/dt [Drug Therapy];bulimia;chronic depression;clinical article;clock (device);controlled study;daytime somnolence;depression;Epworth sleepiness scale;female;generalized anxiety disorder;human;insomnia;Insomnia Severity Index;major depression;male;mental disease;mental instability;Munich ChronoType Questionnaire;obsessive compulsive disorder;panic;Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index;posttraumatic stress disorder;prediction;self report;*sleep;sleep disordered breathing;sleep efficiency;sleep latency;sleep quality;sleep time;sleep walking;social status;time in bed;wake after sleep onset;adapalene plus benzoyl peroxide;aripiprazole/dt [Drug Therapy];caffeine;diazepam/dt [Drug Therapy];emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil;escitalopram/dt [Drug Therapy];etonogestrel;fluoxetine/dt [Drug Therapy];isotretinoin;lorazepam/dt [Drug Therapy];lurasidone/dt [Drug Therapy];melatonin;meloxicam;mirtazapine/dt [Drug Therapy];pizotifen;pregabalin;progesterone;quetiapine/dt [Drug Therapy];risperidone/dt [Drug Therapy];sertraline/dt [Drug Therapy];spironolactone;temazepam/dt [Drug Therapy];thyroxine;venlafaxine/dt [Drug Therapy];zopiclone;accelerometer;actigraph;intrauterine contraceptive device;motion analysis system;Actiwatch 2;GeneActiv Original;Mirena;Borderline Personality Disorder,,,,Subjective and objective sleep in young people with borderline personality disorder features,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The frequency and clinical characteristics of patients, whose subjective sleep efficiency was unimpaired and was in contrast to an objectively conspicuous sleep efficiency in the sense of an overestimation, were investigated in a memory consultation. Methods On 2 consecutive days, patients underwent guideline-oriented diagnostics for dementia (including mini-mental status examination, MMSE and clinical dementia rating, CDR), supplemented by a subjective (Pittsburgh sleep quality index, PSQI) and objective (overnight actigraphy) sleep assessment. Overestimation of sleep efficiency was defined as a subjective sleep efficiency (SSE) of >= 85% with an actigraphic sleep efficiency (ASE) of Results Of 45 patients (74.4 +/- 7.8 years; 26 f/19 m; CDR n = 16, CDR = 1: n = 28; diagnostic groups according to ICD-10: F0: n = 39, F3: n = 5, Z03.x: n = 1) 10 showed an overestimation of sleep efficiency, who showed a lower MMSE score and a higher proportion of patients with a dementia syndrome (CDR = 1) when compared with the other three groups of SSE and ASE >= 85% (n = 17), SSE and ASE <85% (n = 9) and SSE <85% with ASE >= 85% (n = 9). Binary regression showed that MMSE remained an important predictor for overestimation of sleep efficiency.

Satisfying sleep is dependent on a healthy circadian time structure and the circadian patterns among cancer patients are quite abnormal. Wrist actigraphy has been validated with concurrent polysomnography as a reliable tool to objectively measure many standard sleep parameters, as well as daily activity. Actigraphic and subjective sleep data are in agreement when determining activity-sleep patterns and sleep quality/quantity, each of which are severely affected in cancer patients. We investigated the relationship between actigraphic measurement of circadian organization and self-reported subjective sleep quality among patients with advanced lung cancer. METHODS: This cross-sectional and case control study was conducted in 84 patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer in a hospital setting for the patients at Midwestern Regional Medical Center (MRMC), Zion, IL, USA and home setting for the patients at WJB Dorn Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC), Columbia, SC, USA. Prior to chemotherapy treatment, each patient's sleep-activity cycle was measured by actigraphy over a 4-7 day period and sleep quality was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire. RESULTS: The mean age of our patients was 62 years. 65 patients were males while 19 were females. 31 patients had failed prior treatment while 52 were newly diagnosed. Actigraphy and PSQI scores showed significantly disturbed daily sleep-activity cycles and poorer sleep quality in lung cancer patients compared to healthy controls. Nearly all actigraphic parameters strongly correlated with PSQI self-reported sleep quality of inpatients and outpatients. CONCLUSIONS: The correlation of daily activity/sleep time with PSQI-documented sleep indicates that actigraphy can be used as an objective tool and/or to complement subjective assessments of sleep quality in patients with advanced lung cancer. These results suggest that improvements to circadian function may also improve sleep quality.","1740-3391     Grutsch, James F     Wood, Patricia A     Du-Quiton, Jovelyn     Reynolds, Justin L     Lis, Christopher G     Levin, Robert D     Ann Daehler, Mary     Gupta, Digant     Quiton, Dinah Faith T     Hrushesky, William Jm     Journal Article     2011/05/20     J Circadian Rhythms. 2011 May 18;9:4. doi: 10.1186/1740-3391-9-4. | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,Lung;Lung Neoplasms,,,,Validation of actigraphy to assess circadian organization and sleep quality in patients with advanced lung cancer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Individuals with primary insomnia were asked to wear an actigraph and keep a sleep diary for three nights. On the following day, half were shown the discrepancy between the data recorded on the actigraph and their sleep diary (Shown-Discrepancy Group), the other half were not shown the discrepancy (No-Demonstration Group).

Unfortunately, its quality often decreases with aging. A common approach to measuring the sleep characteristics is based on interviews with the subjects or letting them fill in a daily questionnaire and afterward evaluating the obtained data. However, this method has time and personal costs for the interviewer and evaluator of responses. Therefore, it would be important to execute the collection and evaluation of sleep characteristics automatically. To do that, it is necessary to investigate the level of agreement between measurements performed in a traditional way using questionnaires and measurements obtained using electronic monitoring devices. The study presented in this manuscript performs this investigation, comparing such sleep characteristics as â€œtime going to bedâ€, â€œtotal time in bedâ€, â€œtotal sleep timeâ€ and â€œsleep efficiencyâ€. A total number of 106 night records of elderly persons (aged 65+) were analyzed. The results achieved so far reveal the fact that the degree of agreement between the two measurement methods varies substantially for different characteristics, from 31 minutes of mean difference for â€œtime going to bedâ€ to 77 minutes for â€œtotal sleep timeâ€.

The cause of SSM has not yet been elucidated. This study aimed to explore sleep perception tendencies by comparing polysomnography (PSG) data and subjective sleep reports in patients with and without obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 638 participants with PSG results. We classified the participants into three groups based on their OSA severity (non-OSA, n=174; mild OSA, n=214; moderate OSA, n=250), and compared the PSG parameters and various sleep questionnaires among the groups using an analysis of variance. Additionally, we identified the rapid eye movement (REM)-related OSA and compared the variables between the REM-related OSA and non-REM-related OSA groups using independent t and chi-square tests. Results: The participants with less severe OSA presented better quality and quantity of sleep in PSG (longer total sleep time, higher sleep efficiency, fewer arousals, and more deep sleep), but reported much worse sleep disturbances based on sleep questionnaires. Those with REM-related OSA showed a larger discrepancy between subjective and objective sleep. Conclusion: This study found that individuals with milder OSA and REM-related OSA tended to present larger discrepancies in objective and subjective sleep states. Further research based on our preliminary findings is warranted to better recognize SSM and treat complicated sleep disorders.

(see record 2012-25779-014). Nearly 70% of individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) report clinically significant levels of sleep disturbances, and sleep complaints appear more refractory to therapy than other features of the disorder. However, data from several polysomnography (PSG) and actigraphy-based studies suggest that individuals with PTSD often report sleep disturbances in the absence of any demonstrable disruption in objectively measured sleep, calling into question the validity of subjective sleep complaints in PTSD. Kobayashi et al. challenge these conceptualizations of sleep misperception and offer empirical evidence in favor of a more nuanced perspective. Consistently observed discrepancies between subjective and objective indices of sleep impairment among insomnia patients led some researchers to suggest a new phenotype of the disorder called ""paradoxical insomnia"": a condition marked by significant sleep misperception. Kobayashi et al. attempt to overcome these limitations by comparing self-reported sleep data from questionnaires and morning sleep diaries with more objective data from in-lab PSG and home actigraphy. Arguably, the most noteworthy of the findings of Kobayashi et al. is that participants with trauma exposure/PTSD did not exhibit any consistent biases in sleep perception, and, in some cases, estimated sleep more accurately than controls. Finally, though Kobayashi et al. present a provocative argument, replication is necessary in order to increase confidence in the present findings.

R. and Bonnet, M. H.",,,"Objective: Several behavioral, physiological, and subjective variables were examined in subjects reporting chronic insomnia (IN group) and subjects with no complaint of insomnia (NC group) to determine factors predictive of poor sleep as measured by electroencephalography (EEG sleep). Methods: A total of 177 subjects (121 in the IN group and 56 in the NC group) were evaluated on the basis of EEG sleep, subjective sleep, sleepiness, performance, mood, personality, and metabolic parameters during a 36-hour laboratory stay. Results: Equal percentages of subjects in each group had 0, 1, or 2 nights of poor EEG sleep, indicating that the IN group was not more likely to have impaired sleep in the laboratory. Results of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory showed that subjects in the IN group had more pathological personality profiles, and results of laboratory studies showed that these subjects had worse mood ratings, less subjective sleepiness, poorer memory performance, and longer midafternoon sleep latencies. Subjects in the IN group also rated their laboratory sleep as poorer in quality with more time awake after sleep onset and longer sleep latencies, but no differences in EEG sleep were observed. Poor nights of EEG sleep were associated with being male, increasing age, and a history of more time awake after sleep onset; among the laboratory tests, poor EEG sleep was associated with worse mood ratings, poorer memory performance, longer sleep latencies (as indicated by higher scores on the Multiple Sleep Latency Test), higher sleep/wake ratios for metabolic parameters, lower ratings of sleep quality, and longer perceived sleep latencies. Conclusions: A history of chronic insomnia does not predict poor EEG sleep. Both chronic insomnia and poor EEG sleep are associated independently with dysphoria, hyperarousal, diminished waking function, and negative subjective sleep quality. Separate arousal and sleep systems are posited to account for these results.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,Electroencephalography;Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders,,,,Reported chronic insomnia is independent of poor sleep as measured by electroencephalography,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The difference of sleep state evaluation similarly existed in both insomnia group and control group (P < 0.05, for all), but more prominent in insomniacs (P < 0.05), which overestimated their sleep latency particularly.

Methods: A case-control study with the proportion at 1:1:1 was carried out. The patients with paradoxical insomnia were diagnosed in Sleep Medicine Center of West China Hospital of Sichuan University between March 2013 and December 2013. A case of paradoxical insomnia was matched with two controls: a primary insomnia patient and a normal sleeper. A total of 63 matched cases were collected. A face-to-face survey was conducted by using the following scales: General Data Scale and Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQ). Results: The average scores of psychoticism, extraversion, and neuroticism for paradoxical insomnia cases were (52.1+/-10.2), (49.6+/-9.8), and (56.0+/-12.0), respectively. In general, 31.7% of paradoxical insomnia patients had psychoticism or psychoticism tendency in their personality, which were more obvious than those in primary insomnia patients (7.9%) (chi2=11.228, P<0.0125) and normal sleepers (0) (chi2=23.774, P<0.0125). Moreover, 19.0% of paradoxical insomnia patients had extroversion or extroversion tendency in their personality, which were more significant than those in primary insomnia patients (3.2%) (Z=-4.047, P<0.0125) but less obvious than those in normal sleepers (60.3%) (Z=-4.754, P<0.0125). Also, 46.0% of paradoxical insomnia patients had neuroticism or neuroticism tendency in their personality, which were more significant than those in normal sleepers (0) (chi2=37.670, P<0.0125) but similar to those in primary insomnia patients (52.4%) (chi2=0.508, P>0.0125). Conclusion(s): The personal characteristics for paradoxical insomnia patients did not reached obviously abnormal level.

However, measurement errors are common issues with self report methods in medical research. The aim of the present study was to evaluate a self- report method compared to Actigraph in assessing sleep patterns in children. Material(s) and Method(s): This cross-sectional study was conducted on 270 children aged 6 to 9 years who were selected by multistage sampling in primary schools of Tehran. The sleep patterns during a week were measured using two methods of self- report and Actigraph. The parents were asked to report the sleep pattern of their children. Result(s): The results of the current study indicated that sleep duration determined through the self- report method was overestimated compared to Actigraph (P=0.001). Parents reported the onset of children sleep significantly earlier than Actigraph (P=0.001). There was no significant difference between self- report andActigraph for wake -up time. Conclusion(s): The findings of this study illustrate low accuracy of self- report method for determining sleep duration and sleep onset in children. Although, self report is a valid method for measuring wake -up time in children, it has a low validity for assessing the other components of sleep pattern.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,*actimetry;article;child;cross-sectional study;*diagnostic procedure;human;human experiment;preschool child;school child;sleep pattern;sleep time;validation process;*self reported sleep,,,,Validation of self-reported sleep against actigraphy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, to quantify this unique pain experience, objective parameters are not yet available in daily clinical practice. With regard to patients with failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS) treated with spinal cord stimulation (SCS), pain therapists may recover individual functional information about the patient's posture from the implantable pulse generator (IPG) of the stimulator. The aim of this study is to investigate whether subjective self-reporting is in correlation with the functional capacities of a patient. Thirty-nine patients with FBSS, treated with SCS were included. The accelerometer in the IPG detects positional changes and provides an objective output of seven functional positions (lying back, lying prone, lying left, lying right, transition, upright, and upright1mobile). The Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), VAS-diary, and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) were assessed to evaluate physical functioning, pain intensities, and subjective sleep quality. Additionally, 21 patients wore a wearable actigraph device to objectify sleep quality. The agreement and Spearman correlations between objective and subjective parameters were assessed. Spearman correlations revealed no significant correlations between the ODI (subscales walking, sitting, standing, and sleeping) and the output of the IPG (percentage upright & mobile, transition, upright, and lying, respectively). Sleep parameters measured with the Actiwatch and the PSQI were not in agreement. This study demonstrated that self-reporting questionnaires do not correlate with the findings of objective measurements. Therefore, we recommend using both subjective and objective parameters when determining treatment options for FBSS patients.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,accelerometer;actigraph;adult;clinical article;conference abstract;controlled study;*failed back surgery syndrome;female;functional status;human;implantable pulse generator;male;Oswestry Disability Index;Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index;sleep quality;*spinal cord stimulation;walking;Spinal Cord,,,,Is the self-reporting of failed back surgery syndrome patients treated with spinal cord stimulation in line with objective measurements?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our previous studies suggested that about half female athletes had inferior subjective sleep quality. In this study, we focused on objective sleep quality and assessed the difference from subjective sleep quality. Furthermore, we hy-pothesized that there was a relationship between sleep quality and body composition associated with core body temperature, and evaluated the relationship. [Methods] In 19 female colle-giate athletes, who played basketball or athletics, they meas-ured body composition and we conducted the survey using fol-lowing questionnaires * Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Japanese Version of the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, and short form-8. Additionally, all patients underwent overnight home sleep monitoring using portable electroencephalogram (EEG) device. [Results] There was a divergence in total sleep time (TST) and total time in bed (TIB) between subjective and objective sleep quality, and the participants tended to over evaluated TST and TIB (TST : P=0.017 ; TIB : P<0.01). In EEG, % of deep non- REM sleep (N3) in REM sleep latency was correlated with % lean body mass (LBM), Fat mass, and % Fat mass (%LBM : R =0.58 ; Fat mass : R=0.54 ; % Fat mass : R=0.61). [Conclu-sion] There was a gap between subjective and objective sleep quality in female athletes, and they tended to overestimate the quality of their sleep, especially about sleep duration. Poor ob-jective sleep quality may be related to muscle mass. Thus, it is necessary to intervene in sleep management according to body composition changing over time, e.g.,during the season and the off-season.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,adult;*athlete;athletics;basketball;*body composition;conference abstract;controlled study;core temperature;electroencephalogram;Epworth sleepiness scale;fat mass;female;human;lean body weight;muscle mass;nonREM sleep;Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index;questionnaire;REM sleep latency;season;*sleep quality;sleep time;time in bed;Body Composition;Sports,,,,The relationship between body composition and objective sleep quality in female athletes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Each student was home-monitored with an Actiwatch for 7 days, meanwhile parents were asked to complete a detailed sleep diary during the Actiwatch monitoring days. Sleep questionnaires were distributed to their parents who were asked to fill in these on the last monitoring day., RESULT: Forty-five children participated in the study, 36 children completed sleep assessments by all the three methods, and among them 20 were boys and 16 were girls. The mean age of those children was (7.26+/-0.42) years. The completion rate of questionnaire was 100%, of diary was 86.7% (39/45) and of Actiwatch was 93.3% (42/45). The completion rate between sleep diary and sleep questionnaire was significantly different (P<0.05).

The subjective and objective TST, SOL, SE were analyzed by paired t-test, correlation analysis and Bland-Altman analysis. Correlative factors of the difference of subjective and objective sleep were analyzed using multiple linear regression analysis. Results: Bland-Altman analysis showed that the mean differences between subjective and objective TST, SOL, SE were (73.0 +/- 98.2) min, (- 12.9 +/- 22.3) min, (19.7 +/- 14.1)% respectively.

For 21 students, sleep quality was estimated, using both objective and subjective measures, in the days preceding and following an examination. Results of objective measures show there were no any significant alterations of the sleepwake cycle related to the examination period. However, the subjective measures (sleep diary, in particular) showed, in the days prior to examination, the development of a sleep misperception. Students reported an increase of night awakenings and a decrease of total sleep time. This means that, under particular stress conditions, it seems more likely that students experience a sleep misperception related to the days before examination, rather than an objective sleep alteration. Nevertheless, it is suggested that this misperception could itself become a source of stress, and those already predisposed could develop a series of conditionings that could in time lead to the development of a sleep disorder.

Parental understanding of sleep can differ from what clinicians define as a sleep problem. It is therefore important to have information on sleep in Danish children in order to be able to advice parents on normal and deviant sleep. The purpose of this article is to describe the sleep in Danish healthy children. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We examined 211 healthy children aged 6-11 years, recruited in a public school. Their sleep was evaluated objectively with actigraphy. Sleep patterns and sleep problems were examined by means of a questionnaire completed by parents. The objective and subjective measurements were compared. RESULT(S): The most frequently reported sleep problem was fear of falling asleep in the dark, which 19.4% reported. Unwillingness to go to bed was reported in 7.1% and 7.5% had difficulties falling asleep. Actigraphic-measured sleep onset latency was on average 13.5 minutes, while parents reported an average of 21.5 minutes. CONCLUSION(S): The results comply with other findings. As in other sleep studies we found that parents estimate the child's sleep to be poorer than it actually is, although the discrepancy is less than seen in clinical populations. Detailed sleep history, possibly in combination with a sleep diary, can usually identify sleep problems and might be the first step in an effective treatment. Furthermore, actigraphy can be an effective supplement in the unravelling of sleep difficulties.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,article;child;child behavior;Denmark/ep [Epidemiology];education;female;human;male;monitoring;parent;periodicity;physiology;psychological aspect;questionnaire;*sleep;*sleep disorder/di [Diagnosis];*sleep disorder/ep [Epidemiology];Only Child;Child,,,,Sleep and sleep difficulties in Danish children aged 6-11 years,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The frequency and clinical characteristics of patients, whose subjective sleep efficiency was unimpaired and was in contrast to an objectively conspicuous sleep efficiency in the sense of an overestimation, were investigated in a memory consultation., METHODS: On 2 consecutive days, patients underwent guideline-oriented diagnostics for dementia (including mini-mental status examination, MMSE and clinical dementia rating, CDR), supplemented by a subjective (Pittsburgh sleep quality index, PSQI) and objective (overnight actigraphy) sleep assessment. Overestimation of sleep efficiency was defined as a subjective sleep efficiency (SSE) of >=85% with an actigraphic sleep efficiency (ASE) of <85%., RESULTS: Of 45 patients (74.4+/- 7.8 years; 26 f/19m; CDR <1: n= 16, CDR= 1: n= 28; diagnostic groups according to ICD-10: F0: n= 39, F3: n= 5, Z03.x: n= 1) 10 showed an overestimation of sleep efficiency, who showed a lower MMSE score and a higher proportion of patients with a dementia syndrome (CDR= 1) when compared with the other three groups of SSE and ASE >=85% (n= 17), SSE and ASE <85% (n= 9) and SSE <85% with ASE >=85% (n= 9). Binary regression showed that MMSE remained an important predictor for overestimation of sleep efficiency., CONCLUSION: Cognitive deficits in memory clinic patients appear to contribute to a poorer perception and/or an underreporting of objectively disturbed sleep. This could promote false negative subjective screening results in a diagnostic process in which a comprehensive sleep assessment is not routinely considered. Copyright Â© 2021.

However, there is a substantial body of evidence which suggests that sleep has the capacity to distort memory and facilitate the creation of false memories. Previous studies examining the effect of sleep on false memory within the Deese-Roediger-McDermott paradigm have reported mixed results, whereby sleep has been found to increase, decrease, and have no effect on false memory. Previous research has suggested multiple factors that could affect false memory formation within DRM. Therefore, this thesis reports on a series of experiments designed to study some of these factors to examine whether they influence the size of sleep effects on the formation of false memories within the DRM paradigm, namely emotionality of the lists, backward associative strength (BAS), list length and inter-item connectivity. This is in order to address inconsistencies in previous research and to increase our understanding of the factors which influence sleep-dependent consolidation of false memories within the DRM paradigm. Additionally, this thesis further differentiates between early and late sleepers to examine which sleep stage is involved in false memory consolidation. It also compares the total sleep time (TST) scored derived from actigraphy watches and sleep diaries to identify the congruence level between the two methods over five consecutive days. The results of the experiments reveal that sleep increases the level of false memory within the DRM paradigm when inter-item connectivity, BAS and list length are manipulated. However, this effect was not observed when emotional lists were used. The results also indicate that there is no significant effect of sleep stages on the formation of false memory. Furthermore, the results from a comparison of the TST measures from the actigraphy watch and sleep diaries suggest that differentiation between the two methods varies on a day-to-day basis. Experiments reported in this thesis are the first which have sought to investigate how sleep interacts with other factors to create false memory within the DRM paradigm. Specifically, the first two experiments experiment are the first that explored the effect of sleep and three types of emotional DRM lists. The third and fourth experiments are the first that investigated how sleep interact with BAS, inter-item connectivity and list length to effect false memory. The fifth experiment is the first that explored the connection between early and late sleep periods and an increase or decrease in false memory. This thesis offers novel findings and adds significantly to the existing literature on sleep and false memory.","Copyright - Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.

However, previous studies have only utilized subjective and single-night measures of sleep duration. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to examine the clinical utility and influence of habitual, device-measured sleep duration on baseline computerized neurocognitive performance and total concussion symptom severity in college-aged individuals. Methods: This study used a cross-sectional design and included participants aged 18 â€“ 25 years enrolled in university classes (N = 61, mean age 20.30 years). The sleep measures included: habitual, device-measured sleep duration, device-measured single-night sleep duration, subjective, single-night sleep duration, and habitual, subjective sleep duration. Participants provided informed consent, completed a sleep diary, were issued an Actigraph GT9X monitor, and instructed to wear the monitor and complete the morning and evening sections of the sleep diary for 7 continuous days. Participants completed the Immediate Post Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing (ImPACT) battery. Hierarchical linear regressions were used to examine the influence of habitual, device-measured sleep duration on baseline ImPACT performance. Statistical significance was set at p â‰¤ .05. Equivalence testing and Bland-Altman plots were used to determine the level of agreement between 1) device-measured single-night sleep duration and habitual, device-measured sleep duration, and subjective, single-night sleep duration; 2) habitual, device-measured sleep duration and habitual, subjective sleep duration. Results: The average habitual, device-measured total nighttime sleep time was 322.13 minutes (5.37 hours). Habitual, device-measured sleep duration did not influence verbal memory (F2,48 = 0.26, p = .77; R2 = 0.011), visual memory (F2,48 = 0.04, p = .96; R2 = 0.002), visual motor processing speed (F2,48 = 0.41, p = .67; R2 = 0.017), or reaction time (F2,48 = 2.29, p = .11; R2 = 0.087). A significant model was found for total concussion symptom severity (F2,48 = 6.63, p = .003; R2 = 0.216); but habitual, device-measured sleep duration did not significantly contribute to the model (B = -0.002, 95% CI: -0.03, 0.02, Î²= -.02, p = .86). Subjective, single-night sleep duration significantly overestimated device-measured single-night sleep duration (d Ì… = 151.80; Z = -5.08, p â‰¤ .001) and habitual, device-measured sleep duration (d Ì… = 158.03; t41 = -12.30, p â‰¤ .001). Habitual, subjective sleep duration significantly overestimated habitual, device-measured sleep duration (d Ì… = -153.18; t48 = -15.57, p â‰¤ .001). In addition, no agreement was found between 1) device-measured single-night sleep duration, habitual, device-measured sleep duration and subjective, single-night sleep duration; 2) habitual, device-measured sleep duration and habitual, subjective sleep duration. Conclusion: Habitual, device-measured sleep duration did not influence baseline CNT performance or total concussion symptom severity. Further research should determine ImPACT batteryâ€™s sensitivity to habitual sleep and sleep loss. Furthermore, future researchers should investigate how other sleep-related variables, like sleep efficiency, may impact baseline CNT performance. Researchers and clinicians should use caution when using device-derived and subjective measures of sleep duration interchangeably.","Copyright - Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.

Sleep dysregulation is increasingly recognized as an accompanying symptom of ASD, which may lead to, or exacerbate, core behavioral symptoms. The majority of studies investigating sleep in children with ASD use parental subjective measures to collect information about sleep (Elrod & Hood, 2015; Goldman et al., 2011); however, it is unclear whether parentsâ€™ assessment of their childrenâ€™s sleep is consistent with objective ratings of sleep. This study investigated whether subjective parent ratings of their childrenâ€™s sleep and objective sleep equipment ratings varied across three groups of children (i.e., those with ASD, those with developmental disabilities (DD), and those who are typically-developing), such that ratings of parents in the ASD and DD groups would be closer to objective sleep ratings than the ratings of parents of typically-developing children. The study also examined adaptive behavior abilities and age as covariates in the relationship between parental subjective sleep ratings and objective sleep ratings. Method: Thirty-two children with ASD, 6 children with a DD, and 12 typically-developing children participated in an overnight PSG; a parent or guardian filled out a sleep questionnaire about that childâ€™s sleep habits. A two-step multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) tested between and within group effects. Results: Results of the MANCOVA analysis revealed non-significant differences in the discrepancy between subjective and objective sleep ratings of the three groups. Adaptive behavior was not a covariate. When age was included as a covariate, significant results emerged for ratings of total sleep time. Conclusions: Subjective parental ratings of sleep and objective ratings of sleep were not significantly different for any of the three groups, though overall, parents tended to overestimate their childâ€™s sleep time. Additionally, the ASD parents showed a trend in overestimating their childâ€™s sleep efficiency and under-rating the time until sleep onset. Implications for obtaining ratings of a childâ€™s sleep are discussed.","Copyright - Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.

There are few studies in this area in Taiwan.Aim and objectives: The aim of the study was to investigate how quality of sleep impacts on quality of life in individuals with OA in Taiwan. Specific objectives were to measure quality of sleep; to measure pain, physical function, emotional health and quality of life, and investigate their associations with quality of sleep; to investigate predictors of quality of sleep; and to investigate the association between subjective sleep perceptions and objective sleep outcomes.Methods: In a cross-sectional study, 192 OA patients aged over 40, diagnosed by radiology, fluent in Mandarin or Taiwanese, and residing in the community were recruited from musculoskeletal or rehabilitation outpatient departments in a university hospital in Taiwan from October 2010 to March 2011. A supervised self-completion questionnaire was used to collect data. Four validated Mandarin Chinese versions of questionnaires were used: the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) to measure pain and physical functioning; the Short Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36) to measure HRQoL; the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) to measure emotional health; and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) to measure subjective quality of sleep. A sub-sample of 30 individuals was recruited to measure objective sleep quality using an Actigraph wrist monitor. Data were encoded, entered onto computer and analysed with SPSS 16.0 software.Results: Most participants had poor subjective quality of sleep (70.3%), but only 19.8% were taking sleep medication. Global quality of sleep was poorer in participants who were older, female, had a low educational level and had more severe OA. Pain was mild-to-moderate but 47.4% and 25.5% of participants reported no or poor self-management of OA symptoms respectively, and 66.7% never used a walking aid. Poor quality of sleep was associated with pain, poor physical function, anxiety, depression and low scores on the physical and mental components of HRQoL (Pearson correlations 0.27 to 0.87), although most participants did not present problems with anxiety or depression. Regression showed that taking sleep medication, SF-36 role physical and social functioning, high HADS anxiety, a lack of secondary education, high WOMAC pain and taking analgesics significantly contributed to poor global quality of sleep. Path analysis identified four components potentially causing poor quality of sleep: an OA component (pain and physical function), a sleep medication component, a psychological component (anxiety) and a sociodemographic component (low education and poor social functioning), where being female was causally related to the last two. From the objective measurements, participants overestimated the actual time to fall asleep and underestimated their sleep duration and efficiency. Those with poor subjective quality of sleep were woken more often during the night and awake for longer during the night (both p <0.027).Conclusion: Global quality of sleep was poor in individuals with OA in Taiwan; pain, physical function and emotional health negatively influenced quality of sleep and HRQoL. A hypothesised causal model for quality of sleep had components related not only to OA but also to psychological distress, socio-demographics and taking sleep medication. Objective measurements indicated that sleep disturbance was associated with poor perceived quality of sleep. The study suggests that better support and guidance on self-management of OA in Taiwan is required to allow patients more control over their health, well being and quality of sleep.","Copyright - Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.

Despite the significant mental and physical health consequences of SRPs and the high prevalence of SRPs in school-aged children with anxiety, little research has examined sleep treatments for this population. This project utilized a single case multiple baseline design to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a four-session parent training intervention for reducing SRPs in youth with anxiety. Participants were ten children (M=9.6 years, range 8-12 years, 8 female) who met criteria for an anxiety disorder as well as a diagnosis of chronic insomnia. Throughout the study, parents tracked subjective child sleep onset latency (subjective SOL) using a daily sleep diary, children wore actigraphy monitors to capture daily objective sleep onset latency (objective SOL), parents completed a daily parent-child sleep interaction questionnaire, and parents and children completed qualitative interviews at post-treatment. Additional assessment of SRPs occurred at baseline, post-treatment, and one-month follow up. Results of the study showed that it was feasible to design and implement a four-session parent training intervention designed to treat SRPs in school-aged children with anxiety, and that this intervention was acceptable to participants. Consistent with hypotheses, the majority of participants (n=9) no longer met criteria for chronic insomnia at post-treatment or follow-up (n=6), the frequency of SRPs was significantly lower at these time points, and the majority of participants (n=7) reported significant reductions in subjective SOL. However, only three participants showed significant reductions in objective SOL. Qualitative results helped to further clarify this discrepancy by demonstrating that participants experienced a shift in sleep perception across treatment (e.g., before treatment, normal objective SOL lengths were experienced as subjectively longer due to anxiety). Both quantitative and qualitative results demonstrated that parent behaviors (e.g., parental accommodation) and parent-child interactions (e.g., sleep dependence) both improved during the study. Future research should investigate changes in parent behaviors and parent-child interactions as potential mechanisms of treatment.","Copyright - Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.

The National Sleep Foundation recommends that toddlers get 11-14 hours of sleep in 24-hours and go to bed before 9 pm. Accurate sleep assessment is necessary to explore if toddlers are meeting these recommendations. Mothers play a primary role in toddlerâ€™s sleep routines and duration. Conversely, toddler sleep is associated with maternal sleep quality. Poor maternal sleep has been linked to increased mental health symptoms. This reciprocal relationship requires investigation of the mother-toddler dyad, especially among low-income families in whom sleep deficiencies have previously been identified. Purpose: The purpose of this dissertation was to explore toddler sleep and maternal sleep/mental health in low-income families at risk for sleep disparities. Methods: Three cross-sectional studies were conducted. The first tested an integrated model to examine whether associations between perceived toddler sleep problems and maternal mental health varied by co-sleeping versus independent sleeping. The second identified differences between nightly versus non-nightly bedtime routine implementation based on maternal and demographic characteristics, and explored relationships between bedtime routines, awakenings and sleep duration. The final study compared sleep diary to actigraphy measurement of sleep. Results: Perceived toddler sleep problems were associated with an average decrease of 51 minutes in maternal sleep when co-sleeping. Maternal sleep duration mediated the relation between perceived toddler sleep problems and mental health symptoms for co-sleeping mothers. Presence of maternal depressive symptoms, housing insecurity, and food insecurity were associated with decreased likelihood of nightly bedtime routine implementation (all p<0.05); a practice that was found to be associated with long nighttime sleep duration through few nighttime awakenings (Î² = 22.93, 95% CI = 7.41 to 47.04). Compared to actigraphy, sleep diaries underestimated bedtime by an hour, overestimated nighttime sleep duration by 2.5 hours, and overestimated 24-hour sleep duration by 2.25 hours. Conclusions: The relation between maternal/toddler sleep and maternal mental health supports the necessary consideration of the mother-toddler dyad. Factors associated with low socioeconomic status may negatively impact the sleep environment and be related to poor sleep quality. Sleep diaries may not be an accurate sleep measure in this population.","Copyright - Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.

Subjective insomniacs have been found to have difficulty perceiving wake versus sleep. Difficulty discriminating conscious state at sleep onset may lead to a perception of early sleep as wake, resulting in overestimation of sleep onset latency (SOL). Others have suggested that overestimation of sleep onset latency reflects an overall disorder of time estimation. 14 undergraduate insomniacs (estimated usual SOL $>$ 45 minutes) and 17 noncomplaining sleepers (estimated SOL $<$ 20 minutes) had a baseline nap and all-night sleep recording during which they were awakened six times in various EEG-defined stages of sleep. Subjects who were most subjective were more likely to rate their sleep as lighter when awakened from various stages of sleep, indicating support for the sleep/wake discrimination hypothesis. Estimation of time duration on a time estimation task was not positively related to subjectivity, indicating that subjective insomnia is not a reflection of a difficulty of time estimation. Subjects who initially complained of insomnia scored higher on the neuroticism scale of the EPI.

Compared to â€œgood sleepers,â€ individuals with insomnia show lower daytime cognitive performance on several cognitive domains, including verbal memory, working memory and selective attention, information processing, executive functioning, and reaction time. People with insomnia often present with a substantial discrepancy between self-reported sleep and physiological sleep measures, and approximately 1 in 4 of those diagnosed with insomnia makes significant estimation errors regarding the extent of their sleep disturbance, also known as sleep state misperception. Currently, all individuals with insomnia receive the same treatment, despite having different symptoms and, likely, different pathology. As we expect the cognitive cost of objective sleep loss to be greater than that associated with the distress of insufficient sleep, we hypothesized that individuals with insomnia with greater discrepancy have less daytime cognitive difficulties than those who have a measurable lack of sleep. Three to 14 nights of actigraphy and sleep diary data were collected from 40 participants with complaints of chronic sleep disturbances. To measure daytime cognitive performance, participants completed a neuropsychological battery including measures of executive functions, attention, working memory, verbal memory, and psychomotor speed. Results indicated a role of the night-to-night variability of sleep perception in verbal memory and attention in insomnia. Additionally, subjective sleep quality contextualized the impact of subjective sleep estimation on attention and executive functions. Findings support the inclusion of sleep misperception as a diagnostic entity. Clinical and experimental considerations are discussed.","Copyright - Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.

Investigators have traditionally used sleep diaries that were completed daily by participants and collected weekly but have recently begun using sleep diaries that are both completed and collected daily. No research had previously assessed the agreement between daily-collected sleep diaries and actigraph data over one week. Undergraduate students were randomly assigned to use daily- or weekly-collected sleep diaries. Sleep parameters obtained from these measures were compared to each other via concordance with concurrent actigraph data. It was hypothesized that daily-collected sleep diaries would have greater concordance with actigraphy than weekly-collected sleep diaries. Results indicated that daily-collected sleep diaries provided more reliable data than weekly-collected sleep diaries, but the differences were not statistically significant. Additional aims examined self-reported sleep diary adherence, the participation day number, and day of the week. There were trends for the Daily group to have better adherence. Overall concordance did not change based on the day number or day of the week. Both sleep diaries yield comparable sleep parameter data, suggesting that clinicians and researchers can use either method to estimate sleep parameters.","Copyright - Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.

However, it has not been characterized beyond self-report of a perceived problem with sleep disordered breathing (SDB) being most commonly investigated. Poor sleep has significant implications for reduced health-related quality of life, diminished neuroplasticity, and long-term functional outcomes.Methods: This exploratory study utilized an observational prospective study design, collecting objective EEG based sleep data, self-report sleep diary, symptom data and biological marker (DNA methylation) data to characterize sleep and co-occurring symptoms in the subacute rehabilitation phase (30 days post TSCI)over two consecutive nights.Results: Sample (N = 9)were mostly male (75%), Caucasian (89%) with an average age of 45.7 years (SD = 19.6; range = 18â€“71 years). Over half of the TSCI diagnoses were incomplete paraplegia(56%) with ASIA scores of D.Sleep diary reports were variable among participants, however, consistently reported fragmented sleep, underestimates of sleep onset latency (SOL)and wake after sleep onset (WASO), and overestimates of TST. Sleep Profiler summaries scored all participants as having abnormal sleep patterns based on sex and age norms. Sleep architecture, revealed high N1 percentages, and low N3 and REM stages of sleep. SE, was poor across all participants with no one achieving > 85%.Overall, most participants had PHQ-9 severity scores ranging from 2â€“4, indicating no depression. Pain tended to be moderate to high (> 5/10) in most participants on both nights. DNA methylation data was variable across individuals for both genes; however descriptively there were no consistent relationships with sleep variability.Conclusions:The findings of this study support that sleep after TSCI during the subacute rehabilitation phase is significantly impaired based on subjective and objective measures of sleep. The co-occurring impact of depression and pain on sleep was not clear given the likely confounding effects of demographic variables. This study lays a foundation to characterize sleep after SCI and what is considered â€œnormalâ€ that reflects the unique challenges that accompany specialized populations such as those with neurologic injury.","Copyright - Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.

Moreover, limited research indicates ethnic minorities are at higher risk for poor sleep; however, this relationship is not well understood in pregnancy, particularly in Hispanic women, the largest ethnic minority group in the United States. Currently there is no research characterizing subjective and objective sleep in insomnia disorder (ID) during pregnancy in non-Hispanic and Hispanic Caucasian women. The present study aimed to examine (1) ethnic differences among subjective and objective sleep parameters and (2) the discrepancy between objectively measured and subjectively reported nocturnal total sleep time (TST) in Hispanic and non-Hispanic pregnant women with ID. It additionally explored weather acculturation was associated with more sleep disturbances in Hispanic pregnant women.Ninety-one women taking part in a randomized control trial completed sleep diaries (subjective), wore an Actiwatch (objective), and completed the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and the Acculturation Rating Scale for Mexican Americans-II (ARSMA-II) at the baseline visit. Multiple regression models were used to analyze the data. The results indicated ethnicity was associated with subjectively and objectively measured sleep parameters after controlling for household income and depressive symptoms. Identifying as Hispanic was associated with higher ISI scores, an increase in objectively measured sleep onset latency, a decrease in nocturnal TST, and lower sleep efficiency. Additionally, results suggested no association between ethnicity and the discrepancy between objectively measured and subjectively reported nocturnal TST. In the Hispanic sample, acculturation was not associated with sleep disturbances. Analysis suggest that among Caucasian pregnant women with ID, Hispanic ethnicity is associated with increased symptom severity by self-report and this finding is corroborated by objective findings. Hispanic pregnant women with ID are more likely to experience shorter sleep durations which have been linked to adverse health outcomes and poorer outcomes in CBT for insomnia. This highlights the need for better assessment of ID in clinics in order to reach and offer treatment to this high risk population.","Copyright - Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.

This thesis tested four aspects of the relationships between sleep, cardiovascular risk and well-being using different methods of investigation; an analysis of a large population dataset (the English Longitudinal Study of Aging (Study 1)), an investigation of affective and biological responses in everyday life of working women (Studies 2, 3), and a short-term well-being intervention (Study 4). Studies 1 and 2 tested whether direct biological dysregulation may be in part responsible for higher risk of cardiovascular outcomes in poor sleepers. Study 1 found that in older adults longer sleep was correlated with elevated inflammation, while short sleep was associated with low haemoglobin. Disturbed sleep was more prevalent among those with higher inflammation, lower dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate and haemoglobin as well as anaemia. These relationships were found mostly in men, but nonetheless they emphasise that self-reported sleep has important biological correlates in older adults. Study 2 extended data from experimental studies to real life settings, and found that disturbed sleep is related to lower heart rate variability (HRV). This suggests that lower HRV, a marker of dysfunctional autonomic activity, may be another pathway contributing towards higher risk of cardiovascular outcomes in poor sleepers. Study 3 compared objective and subjective measures of sleep efficiency and discovered that psychosocial characteristics including work stress and social support are related to underestimations of sleep efficiency, in comparison with objective measures. Thus associations between self-reported sleep and health-related factors may be overestimated in studies based on self-report. Study 4 aimed to induce positive well-being in a randomised controlled trial, to test whether this would lead to improvements in sleep. Well-being was increased post-intervention, but improvements in sleep were marginal. Importantly, changes in well-being were correlated with beneficial alternations in subjective sleep, tentatively suggesting that positive well-being may exert protective effects on (self-reported) sleep. In combination, these studies contribute to the research literature relating sleep problems with cardiovascular risk and poor psychological well-being.","Copyright - Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.

Although sleep-state misperception has been observed in home and laboratory settings, it is unclear if the magnitude of the discrepancy between self-reported and objectively measured sleep differs depending on sleep location. The purpose of the current study was to determine whether the difference between self-reported and actigraphy measured sleep varied depending on sleep location, and if these differences were due to differences in pre-sleep arousal between the home and the laboratory. Although differences in pre-sleep arousal did not predict differences between sleep-state misperception at home and in the laboratory, results demonstrated that sleep-state misperception is present in both home and laboratory settings and that estimates of sleep-state misperception based on one night of laboratory data may over-estimate the severity of the problem. Therefore, researchers and clinicians should consider how the method and location of sleep assessment they use in their studies and clinical practice impacts sleep and the results of research and clinical assessments.","Copyright - Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.

An epidemiological study of registered blind subjects (N = 388) established that 58% had a sleep disorder as assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI > 5). The incidence and severity of sleep disorder was greater in subjects with no conscious light perception (NPL) (78%, PSQI meanÂ±sem = 8.1Â±0.5, n = 58) compared to subjects with some degree of light perception (LP) (54%. PSQI mean = 5.8Â±0.2, n = 330). In order to investigate whether the high incidence of sleep disorder was due to circadian rhythm abnormality, a detailed evaluation of circadian rhythms in the blind was conducted. A total of 49 blind subjects (30 NPL and 19 LP) with varying degrees of severity of visual loss were studied for at least four weeks. Subjects were required to keep daily sleep and naps diaries and wear wrist-worn actigraphs continually. They were asked to complete four analogue mood scales and an auditory performance test every two hours whilst awake for 48 h each week. During the same 48 h each week, urine was collected (4-hourly and 8-hourly overnight) for analysis of 6-sulphatoxymelatonin (aMT6s), the major metabolite of melatonin and considered to be a reliable marker of circadian phase. The majority of LP subjects (14/19, 74%) had normally entrained aMT6s rhythms whereas the majority of NPL subjects had abnormal aMT6s rhythms (23/30, 76%). Free-running aMT6s rhythms were only found in NPL subjects (17/30, 57%) the incidence of which was greater in bilaterally enucleated subjects (11/12) compared to those with one (5/7) or both eyes (2/12) present. All of the NPL individuals with abnormally entrained rhythms (n = 5) had both eyes present. The effect of the circadian system on sleep was investigated using both the subjective and actigraphically-derived sleep data. In group analysis of subjects with entrained aMT6s rhythms, there was a strong positive correlation between the timing of sleep and activity with the timing of the aMT6s acrophase. Regression analysis of sleep and activity showed that some individuals with a free-running aMT6s rhythm also had a free-running activity, sleep or nap rhythm although at a much reduced tau compared to the aMT6s rhythm. The effect of age on the timing of behavioural rhythms was also measured in entrained subjects and found that increased age was associated with an advance in the timing of mean sleep onset. The study also showed that there were significantly more naps of a longer duration in NPL subjects (meanÂ±sem = 0.6Â±0.1 naps/day, 0.4Â±0.1 h/day) compared to LP subjects (0.3Â±0.1 naps/day, 0.2Â±0 h/day). When analysed with respect to circadian rhythm type, the results showed that normally entrained subjects had significantly fewer naps per day compared to all other circadian rhythm types. The timing of the naps was not random; there were significantly more naps (65%) within a 5 h range before and after the aMT6s acrophase. Further analysis of sleep, naps and activity with respect to circadian phase in free-running subjects showed that the number and duration of naps decreased when the aMT6s acrophase was in a normal phase position (24.00 - 06.00 h) and increased when the aMT6s acrophase was maximally out of phase. There were also significant effects of circadian phase on the timing and duration of night-time sleep with maximal night sleep duration occurring when the aMT6s acrophase was normal and minimal when the aMT6s acrophase was out of phase. The timing of sleep onset and offset also changed with circadian phase, being advanced when the aMT6s was advanced relative to normal (18.00 - 24.00 h) and delayed when the aMT6s acrophase was relatively delayed (06.00 - 12.00 h). It was observed that sleep onset and offset did not vary in parallel with circadian phase and this may provide the basis of a model to investigate the effects of circadian influences on sleep. Preliminary analysis of mood and performance did not reveal a robust rhythm as assessed by fitting cosine curves to the data. There was a significant effect of circadian phase on daily mean mood (calmness) and performance (% gaps) in group analysis of six free-running subjects although more detailed analysis is required before any conclusions can be drawn. Comparisons were performed on the simultaneous subjective and actigraphic measurement of sleep for the whole study in all subjects. There was a high rate of disagreement between the two methods in the measurements of absolute sleep parameters , especially when measuring the number and duration of day- or night-time sleeps. However, both methods gave comparable results when measuring changes in sleep over time and the effects of circadian phase on sleep. These results of this thesis show that individuals with no light perception (NPL) are likely to have abnormal circadian rhythms. This is associated with increased incidence and duration of naps, the timing of which is associated with the timing of the aMT6s acrophase. In some free-running individuals, there are also distinct cyclical variations in the timing of sleep in relation to circadian phase.","Copyright - Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.

These studies often compare subjective and objective methods of sleep measurement to observe whether or not they are in agreement. In this thesis, we examine concordance between a subjective sleep measurement, in the form of a questionnaire, and an objective sleep measurement, in the form of an actigraphic sleep watch. Four subjective questions were paired with four actigraphic sleep measurements for analysis. Continuous actigraphic measurements were categorized into quartiles or deciles to compare with their subjective categorical counterparts. Concordance was tested using three-level nested longitudinal models and Bland-Altman plots. We also analyze these variables to check for a directional influence over time using cross-lag regression methods. The intraclass correlations from the longitudinal analysis and the Bland Altman plots both revealed that the two methods of sleep measurement are not concordant. The cross-lag regression analysis indicated that there is a statistically significant directional influence for the participantsâ€™ number of awakenings and quality of sleep. Our findings supplement the findings of prior research about the lack of concordance of sleep measurement, while also adding to this work by considering directional influence. Public Health Significance: Sleep habits can impact a personâ€™s immune system, metabolism, autonomic nervous system activity, and mental health. Understanding if different methods of sleep measurement are concordant is necessary for future investigators to assess the accuracy of each measurement and choose which measurement is the most appropriate for their research. The cross-lag regression methods used in this analysis could be utilized by future researchers to understand the directional influence of other sleep variables over time.","Copyright - Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.

An increasingly common complaint amongst caregivers of persons with dementia is disturbed sleep. Previous investigations of caregiver sleep show that caregivers experience a mixture of good and poor nights of sleep that are not well explained by analyzing mean aggregates. This pattern of variability is one of the hallmarks of the development of chronic insomnia, as the unpredictability of sleep can lead to anxiety regarding future nights of sleep. This study utilized measures of night-to-night intraindividual variability across several sleep parameters as well as comparisons of subjectively and objectively measured sleep to advance the understanding of the nature of sleep disturbances in caregivers reporting sleep difficulties. Nightly variability in both subjectively and objectively measured sleep in caregivers was compared to two non-caregiving samples, with and without sleep disturbances. This study also examined concordance between subjective and objective sleep measurements in caregiving and both non-caregiving samples to further distinguish caregiversâ€™ experiences of sleep disturbance from those of non-caregivers, as caregivers have previously demonstrated high levels of concordance between these measures. Finally, this investigation examined the potential relationships between stress, care recipient needs, and nightly sleep variability. Results revealed that actigraphic measurements estimated that CGs experience greater variability in SOL and TWT than both non-CG groups and greater WASO and TST variability than non-CGs without sleep complaints. However, in sleep diary measures, CGs were not significantly different from non-CGs with sleep complaints, but both groups had greater variability in WASO, SQR, TWT, and TST than non-CGs without sleep complaint. Within CGs only, caregiving-related WASO was significantly higher and more variable than WASO for personal needs. CGs did not demonstrate greater concordance between sleep diaries and actigraphy than non-CG groups, and relationships between sleep variability, stress, caregiver burden, depression, and care recipient behaviors were non-significant. These results suggest that CG sleep disturbance is largely organized around the nightly needs of their care recipient. Future research should focus on methodology design for distinguishing differences in CG sleep beyond the standard structure of current sleep diaries and actigraphy.","Copyright - Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.

In two experiments, a Signal Detection Theory framework was used to systematically assess the extent of this discrepancy in normal sleepers. The main hypothesis was that polygraphic criteria are an external, recordable index of an internal ""state"" that is detected by subjects and used by them to decide whether they have been awake or asleep. Eleven normal sleepers (20-35 years old) spent six nonconsecutive nights, one adaptation night and five experimental nights, in the laboratory. An average of twelve trials were studied per experimental night: eight during polygraphically defined sleep (Stage 2 or REM) and four during wakefulness. For each sleep or wake trial, the subject was alerted by a telephone ring and asked to state whether he was ""awake"" or ""asleep"" just before hearing the ring. The subject was then asked to rate how confident he was of that answer on a three-point scale: (1) positive, (2) pretty sure, or (3) not so sure. Six of the original eleven subjects were asked to participate in a second condition (an additional five experimental nights) of study. They were assigned, in a counter-balanced order, to one of two a priori instruction set and limited performance feedback conditions. Sleep-wake discrimination out of REM sleep was affected significantly more by a priori instruction set and limited performance feedback than sleep-wake discrimination out of stage 2 sleep, F(1,4) = 14.9, p < .025. A priori instruction set and limited feedback did significantly affect the response bias associated with discrimination of EEG wakefulness from EEG stage 2 or REM sleep, F(1,4) = 6.89, p < .10. The hypothesis that polygraphic data are closely correlated with internal signals that are detected by subjects and used by them to decide whether they have been awake or asleep was supported only in part. Normal sleepers do not detect polygraphic stage 2 sleep as being sleep fifty-five percent of the time and they do not detect REM sleep as being sleep twenty-seven percent of the time. The significant bias associated with all subject responses toward reporting 'awake' regardless of polygraphic criteria demonstrates that the sleep-wake decision process of normal sleepers is strongly dependent on factors independent of the conventional polygraphic criteria. These results seriously question the adequacy of conventional polygraphic criteria to decide whether or not someone has been asleep.","Copyright - Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.

This thesis provides a novel contribution to the literature by utilising auditory stimuli to examine the propositions of the Neurocognitive Model as a method of both eliciting and measuring the effects of cortical arousal. Firstly, the effect of noise on sleep was observed within the habituated home environment, evidencing that NREM sleep may be more susceptible to increased arousal through noise comparative to REM. Furthermore, traits typically associated with insomnia showed relationships with sleep disturbance due to noise, indicative that noise may increase cortical arousal. Secondly, the administration of novel noise in a non-habituated laboratory environment was utilised to raise cortical arousal levels in good sleepers to directly test the propositions of the Neurocognitive Model. Results demonstrated that noise altered both subjective and objective sleep along with creating a misperception of sleep onset, albeit not associated with explicit memory of noise stimuli. Finally, utilising individuals assumed to be experiencing heightened cortical arousal (insomnia) and good sleepers, words were administered during sleep onset periods to directly assess the processing and misperception components of the Neurocognitive model. Results demonstrated that both explicit and implicit recognition for words presented during sleep was greater for individuals with insomnia, yet this did not associate with a misperception of sleep. Therefore, this thesis proposes that the Neurocognitive Model could be a model of the effects of raised cortical arousal on sleep of which the two outcome pathways are the processing of auditory stimuli and sleep state misperception. Future research may wish to continue to examine the role of cortical arousal in the context of the Neurocognitive Model as a potential mechanism of sleep state misperception in those with insomnia and vulnerable good sleepers.","Copyright - Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.

During an initial laboratory session, they answered a 68-item sleep questionnaire, completed waking time estimation tasks, and reported their mental content while awake and lying on a bed. EEG, EOG, EKG, heart rate, and skin conductance were recorded during a second session which occurred in the afternoon or early evening. When subjects had achieved 5 minutes of stage 2 sleep, they were asked whether they had just been asleep, how certain they were of their answers, how long it had been since they began attempting sleep, and questions about their mental activities and physical sensations. The questions were repeated after the first sleep spindle, and again 1.4 minutes into stage 1 sleep. Significantly more insomniacs (60%) than good sleepers (17%) reported being awake 5 minutes into stage 2 sleep and in stage 1 sleep. Subjects whose report was concordant with polygraphically defined sleep differed from discordant subjects only in reporting more alertness and less blankness of mind. Compared with their waking reports, discordant subjects reported more alertness and fewer discrete mental experiences after stage 1 sleep, but there were no differences after stage 2 sleep. The two groups did not differ on any physiological, duration experience, pre-bedtime substance consumption, or sleep difficulty parameters; nor were there differences on bed-related stimuli/activities variables. Experiences which differentiated subjects who were polygraphically asleep versus awake, as well as insomniacs from good sleepers, were discussed. Strategies were proposed for identifying effective treatment for subjective insomnia, including exploration of cognitive manipulations such as training to focus on experiences associated with sleep and sleep state discrimination training.","Copyright - Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.

The etiology of sleep problems is not well understood as they may arise from disease-related pathology or from factors such as motor dysfunction or medications. They may also affect the integrity of cognitive processes. In other disorders, actigraphy has emerged as an alternative to polysomnography to measure sleep, raising the question of its ability to capture sleep quality in PD. Study #1 evaluated the validity of actigraphy by examining its association with self-report in 30 patients with PD and 14 normal control participants (NC). For NC, actigraphic sleep variables were not related to any self-reported measures of sleep, a finding consistent with previous reports of over-reporting of sleep problems in older adults. In PD patients these correlations were significant, suggesting that actigraphy is an appropriate method of measuring sleep quality in PD. Study #2 investigated factors associated with sleep disturbance using actigraphy and questionnaire measures in 35 PD patients. Motor symptom severity and dopaminergic medication dosages were significantly related to sleep quality. Other factors affecting sleep were disease subtypes, with non-tremor onset patients reporting worse sleep quality than tremor-onset patients, and gender, with men having worse sleep quality and more excessive daytime sleepiness than women. Actigraphy identified individuals with possible REM behavior disorder, a sleep disorder that is implicated in early detection of PD. Study #3 investigated the association between actigraphic sleep measures and cognition in 36 PD patients and 18 NC participants. Executive dysfunction was predicted by sleep efficiency and not by motor symptom severity, medication dosage or disease duration. For memory, by contrast, motor symptom severity and disease duration but not sleep quality predicted performance. For psychomotor function, none of the variables significantly predicted performance. The relation of sleep and cognition in PD varied with gender and motor symptom subtypes. Taken together, these studies show actigraphy to be a valid method of assessing sleep quality in non-demented PD patients, indicate the relation of sleep to motor symptom severity, medication, gender, and disease subtypes, and demonstrate that sleep disturbances in PD significantly predict cognitive functioning.","Copyright - Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.

Poor sleepers post head injury (HI) have significantly worse sustained attention than good sleepers post HI (Bloomfield et al., 2010, Sinclair et al., 2013). Aims: The present study explores the relationships between objective and subjective sleep measures and overall cognitive functioning, sustained attention, memory and executive functioning in people with an Acquired Brain Injury (ABI) who are currently participating in inpatient neurorehabilitation. Methods: This study has a correlational design with exploratory between groups analyses. Twenty participants were recruited and their sleep was assessed using a subjective (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index; PSQI) and an objective (Actigraphy) measure of sleep. Cognitive tests were completed to determine current cognitive functioning on specific cognitive domains. Results: Self-reported sleep difficulties were associated with better overall cognitive functioning (r=0.46, N=20, p=0.04) and memory domain scores (r=0.50, N=20, p=0.01). No associations were found between Actigraphy and cognitive performance. There were discrepancies between subjective and objective sleep measures in 45% of participants. 67% of participants with discrepancies between sleep measures under reported poor sleep and 33% over reported poor sleep when compared to an objective measure. Exploratory analysis of clearly good and poor sleepers, defined by congruent objective and subjective sleep measures, revealed poor sleepers have significantly better memory cognitive domain scores than good sleepers (t(9)=2.27, p=0.049;d=1.37). Conclusions/Recommendations: The phenomenon of poor sleep and better memory performance may be explained by poor sleepers having better memory for their difficulties post injury than good sleepers or increased awareness of their current sleep patterns because their memory is better preserved. Clinicians should adopt an objective measure of sleep in addition to subjective measures of sleep when assessing sleep difficulties in an inpatient neurorehabilitation population. Patients who do not report sleep difficulties may in fact be experiencing sleep problems that that could impact on their neurorehabilitation schedule.","Copyright - Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.

Imbalanced autonomic nervous system (ANS) has been proposed to be one of the pathophysiology for IBS. Polysomnography (PSG) is a gold measure for sleep quality and heart rate variability (HRV) is a non-invasive measure of ANS activity. Correlations between HRV parameters and electroencephalogram (EEG) power band have been reported in healthy participants and the correlations are weaker among some patient population, e.g., insomnia. Objective A systematic review was conducted to evaluate the evidence of sleep disturbances in adults with IBS and their relationship with GI symptoms. A secondary data analysis was conducted to investigate the relationship between the high frequency (HF) power of HRV and EEG delta band power in women with IBS compared to healthy control women. Methods A literature search was conducted in PubMed, CINAHL, and PsycINFO using keyword â€˜irritable bowel syndromeâ€™ and â€˜sleepâ€™. In the second study, HRV and EEG data were recorded using PSG in 20 women with IBS and 20 healthy control women in a sleep laboratory for three consecutive nights. Data from the second night were used for this analysis. The traditional coherence analysis was used to determine the coherence, gain, and phase shift between normalized high frequency (HF) power of HRV and normalized delta band power of EEG in the first four NREM-REM sleep cycles. Results The systematic review showed that sleep disturbances are common in adults with IBS. Sleep discrepancy is found between objective and subjective sleep measures. Some evidence supports the positive association between increased sleep disturbances and exacerbated GI symptoms. In the second study, women with IBS had slightly lower coherence between normalized HF and normalized EEG delta band power but it was not statistically significant; had longer phase shift between HF and delta band power than controls (11.6Â±4.8 min vs. 6.3Â±3.0 min). Conclusion Sleep disturbances are common in adults with IBS, which also related to exacerbation of GI symptoms. Based on the coherence analysis, there is evidence of dysfunction in the communication between ANS and CNS in women with IBS.","Copyright - Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.

Subjective reports from trauma survivors have consistently indicated difficulties in sleep onset, sleep maintenance, overall quality and quantity of sleep. However, objective physiological research has yielded inconsistent findings in PTSD-related sleep impairment. Studies investigating subjective and objective assessments concordantly support a theory of sleep state misperception â€“ subjective overestimation of sleep disturbance â€“ in PTSD. The majority of these previous investigations have been limited to male, veteran cohorts and have not accounted for the effects of psychiatric comorbidity, such as major depression. The current study examines PTSD-related sleep disturbance in a female interpersonal violence cohort (N=51) assessing subjective and objective physiological (actigraphy) sleep measures concurrently. Specific aims of the study addressed the presence of sleep state misperception in a female PTSD cohort and the effect of comorbid depression symptoms and diagnosis on PTSD-related sleep impairment. Analyses revealed an overall subjective over-reporting of sleep disturbance when compared to objective physiological measurement. Subjective reports of sleep onset latency were significantly higher than objective measures (t (50) = 4.59, p < .001), and subjective sleep quality (t (50) = 6.03, p < .001) and sleep quantity (t (50) = 4.52, p < .001) were significantly lower than objective assessment. No significant differences were displayed between PTSD-only and PTSD/MDD groups across subjective, objective and sleep state misperception scores for any of the target sleep parameters. However, 24% of the variability in sleep state misperception was predicted by the regression model including re-experiencing symptoms and depressive symptoms as significant contributors (p < .01). Re-experiencing symptoms accounted for 13% of the variance in sleep state misperception, and depressive symptoms contributed a unique 9% of variance (p < .05). Avoidance and, surprisingly, hyperarousal symptoms, were not significant predictors of sleep state misperception. Overall, findings support the existence of sleep state misperception in a PTSDpositive female cohort. Results also point to the importance of accounting for depressive and re-experiencing symptoms as predictors of subjective sleep impairment in a PTSD cohort.

However individuals from elite sports, such as soccer, may be exposed to a number of situations that may impact sleep within the competitive season (such as inconsistent schedules and travel), which may result in sub-optimal sleeping patterns. However, research documenting the sleep of soccer players is at present limited. Therefore it would seem important to investigate how soccer players sleep to further the understanding of how sleep may be impacted. On this basis, the aim of the current thesis was to examine the typical sleeping patterns of youth soccer players and the factors effecting sleep. This was completed through a series of investigations conducted during the competitive youth soccer season. The aim of the first study (Chapter 3) was to validate a commercially available wireless sleep-monitoring device (WS). This was done in an attempt to provide a viable methodology to measure sleep within the habitual environment of soccer players. Nine randomly selected male participants were monitored over 3 nights and comparisons were made between the WS and other established field measures of sleep (Wristwatch actigraphy, sleep diary and Firstbeat bodyguard heart rate system). The relationships between the WS and the other sleep devices, indicated strong to very strong correlations (r > 0.6) and no significant differences between a range of outputs; total sleep time (Actigraphy assumed sleep time [0.97] & Sleep Diary [0.87] p >0.05), sleep onset latency (Actigraphy [0.69] p > 0.05) and number of awakenings (Sleep Diary [0.69], p > 0.05). There were also low bias and narrow limits of agreement (LOA) within the comparison of mean differences with the WS for assumed sleep time (2 Â± 17 min 95% LOA: -30 to 34 min [Actigraphy]), sleep onset latency (7 Â± 17 min, 95% LOA -28 to 40 min [Actigraphy]), and number of awakenings (0.05 Â± 1, 95% LOA -3 to 3 [Sleep Diary]). These results suggested that the WS is a viable device for the detection of these selected sleep variables. Chapter 4 looked to provide a comparison of sleep measures between a sample of youth soccer players (N=8) and non-athletes (N=8). Both groups were monitored over a period of 6 days within the habitual setting using the WS. The findings showed the soccer player group attained greater amounts of sleep quantity in comparison to the non-athlete group (504 Â± 22 vs. 433 Â± 46 min [+71 min] total sleep time, ES: 2.0, Large, p < 0.01). This may have been as a result of a later time of final awakening (08:54 Â± 00:14 vs. 07:34 Â± 00:46 [+77 min], ES: 1.7, Large, p < 0.01). Such an observation suggested that the soccer players were afforded greater time in bed as a result of the imposed soccer schedule. The soccer players also displayed a statistically greater time spent in wake (13(13) vs. 3(5) min [+10 min], PS: 0.86 ES: 1.5, Large, p < 0.05) on average each night. This data suggested that the sleep of the youth soccer players might be less efficient (as a consequence of greater levels of disturbance), despite desirable quantities of sleep being attained than non-athlete controls. Chapter 5 provided a daily comparison of sleep measures conducted over a 14-day assessment period. It is apparent that youth soccer players attained more sleep quantity in the nights preceding the match day (M-2: 488 Â± 53 min [ES: 0.91, Moderate; p = 0.06] & M-1: 486 Â± 64 min [ES: 0.84, Moderate; p = 0.02] respectively) in comparison to the night of the day after the match day (M+1: 422 Â± 61 min). Such a finding suggested that youth soccer players adopt behaviours that reduce their sleep quantity on the designated recovery day (M+1) by >60 min, which may impact the recovery processes associated to this day. Relationships between sleep parameters and training and match load indicated a 100 au rise in RPELOAD (RPE * Duration) increased the time spent in wake (42 s [90% CI: 0 to 84 s]; ES: 0.36, Small; p = 0.098). It was also observed that an increase of 1000 m total distance increased the time spent in wake (40 s [90% CI: 5 to 75 s]; ES: 0.33, small; p = 0.06) A 100 m rise in high-speed running distance increased the number of awakenings observed (0.14 [90% CI: 0.03 to 0.25]; ES: 0.28, p =0.04) and the time spent in wake on average each night (1.5 min [90% CI: 0.78 to 2.3 min]; ES: 0.57, Small; p = 0.04). A similar outcome was observed in Chapter 6 were a 100 m rise in average high-speed running distance across three different 14-day training periods during the youth soccer season showed a 5 min increase in the time spent in wake on average (ES: 0.88, moderate; p = 0.04). Such outcomes provided a potential link between increases in training intensity (i.e. high-speed running distance) and sleep disturbances within youth soccer players. Increases in high-speed running distance also related to an increase of 24 min (90% CI: 12 to 36 min) on average for total sleep time (ES: 1.3, large; p < 0.01). Similarly increased high intensity heart rate (>85% max HR) was shown to effect total sleep time +20 min (90% CI: 6 to 32 min; ES: 0.87, moderate; p = 0.035). This may suggest that increases in intensity also may impact the amount of sleep quantity within youth soccer players. At present the mechanism for this response largely remains unknown. Within Chapter 7, a practical sleep hygiene strategy (10 min showering at ~40 Â°C, 20 min before time of lights out) was investigated. A group of ten youth soccer players were evaluated under normal sleeping conditions (control) and a shower intervention period, each consisting of three days within a randomized cross over trial design. Sleep information was collected using the WS. In addition to skin temperature, which was evaluated using iButton skin thermistors. The iButtons were used to establish both distal and proximal skin temperatures. This data was also used to create the distal to proximal gradient (average of distal measures - average of proximal measures = DPG). The data demonstrated that the shower intervention elevated distal skin temperature by (+1.1 Â°C [95% CI: 0.1 to 2.1Â°C]; ES: 0.44, Small; p = 0.04) on average during a 10-minute period prior to lights out in comparison to the control condition. This elevation was also present during the first 30 minutes following lights out (1.0 Â°C [95% CI: 0.4 to 1.6Â°C]; ES: 0.65, Moderate; p < 0.01), which was also accompanied by an increased DPG between conditions (0.7 Â°C [95% CI: 0.3 to 1.2 Â°C]; ES: 0.45, Small; p < 0.01). Additionally it was observed that on average the sleep onset latency of the youth soccer players was lower in the shower intervention condition (-7min [95% CI: -13 to -2 min]; ES -0.55, Moderate; p = 0.007). However no other sleep variable was affected as a result of the intervention. These findings demonstrate that a warm shower performed before lights out may offer a practical strategy to alter the thermoregulatory properties of distal skin temperature, which may advance sleep onset latency within youth soccer players.","Copyright - Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.

In this study, subjective insomniacs were taught to estimate sleep more accurately. Ten subjective insomniacs between eighteen and forty years of age were carefully screened for psychopathology and sleep disturbances. Subjects were randomly assigned to one of two groups. Group 1 subjects spent seven nights in the lab and received both the control and treatment protocol. The control protocol always preceded the treatment protocol. Group 2 subjects participated only in the treatment protocol, and spent four nights in the lab. Control and treatment weeks each contained a baseline, a disruption (treatment or no treatment), a home and a recovery night. On disruption nights, subjects were awakened from sleep and estimated whether they were asleep or awake. Treatment subjects were taught to use sleep markers (A, B or C) to help them identify varying points along the sleep onset continuum. Marker A corresponded to an EEG level of wakefulness; Marker B corresponded to a sleep spindle (an EEG waveform of twelve to fourteen hertz); Marker C corresponded to five minutes of continuous sleep after the first sleep spindle. Treatment subjects were given feedback as to the accuracy of their estimations. Control subjects were not taught the use of markers and did not receive feedback about their sleep estimations. Ten normal sleepers, with similar demographic variables, were compared under analogous conditions. Normal sleepers estimated sleep from wake well at baseline and improved after treatment. With treatment, subjective insomniacs attained a high degree of accuracy in their sleep-wake estimations. After treatment, subjects' ratings for their perceived ability to fall asleep within sixty minutes and within thirty minutes improved. ""Vigor"", as measured by the Profile of Mood States (POMS), increased and ""tension"", as measured by the POMS, decreased after treatment. Total sleep time and percent of stage three sleep were increased on recovery nights. Sleep latency and the number of awakenings from sleep were reduced on recovery nights. Presleep cognitions changed on recovery nights. It is proposed that any mechanism which makes sleep and wake distinct will improve subjective insomnia.","Copyright - Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.

We embarked on a home polysomnography study of depressed patients in order to investigate whether a drug that blocks a particular serotonin receptor (5-HT2A) confers any advantage in sleep over a classical serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI).Â  We found that blockade of 5-HT2A improved both subjective and objective measures of sleep early in treatment, but these effects tended to disappear later.Â  It appears that compounds with relatively more 5-HT2C than 5-HT2A blocking properties might prove to be better hypnagogics. The data collected during the above study also allowed us to investigate post hoc other issues of interest.Â  We examined whether delta sleep ratio (DSR) is a potential predictor of clinical response to antidepressants, but we found that this index was not related to remission but rather to the particular medication taken by the patients.Â  We also tested the implicit assumption that objective and subjective sleep assessments correspond in what they measure.Â  We found a partial discrepancy between these measures and we concluded that the two ways of assessing sleep are not wholly interchangeable, and they should still be used in tandem. Finally, we used the tryptophan depletion technique to explore the role of serotonin in social anxiety.Â  We showed that depletion of this aminoacid led to a significant increase of anxiety in SSRI treated patients, thus indicating that these drugs exert their effect by increasing 5-HT availability and that a relatively deficiency of serotonin may partly underpin the neurobiology of social phobia.","Copyright - Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.

Confirming that distorted perception of sleep is a hallmark of the majority of people with insomnia, Study 1 indicated that people with insomnia overestimate their SOL and underestimate their TST, relative to good sleepers.Â  Correlational evidence suggested that those who exhibit more distorted perception of sleep are also those who report a more severe sleep disturbance.Â  Four studies were devoted to evaluating four mechanisms hypothesised to underpin distorted perception of sleep.Â  Whilst the evidence from Study 2 did not support poor time estimation ability as an explanation of the distorted perception, the results of Studies 3, 4 and 5 indicated that the manifestation of distorted perception of sleep is attributable to excessive cognitive arousal, physiological arousal, and monitoring for sleep-related threat during the pre-sleep period.Â  Finally, Studies 6 and 7 demonstrated therapeutic benefits arising from correcting distorted perception of sleep using a behavioural experiment that involved showing the discrepancy between the patient's subjective and objective sleep estimates.Â  This behavioural experiment was found to be effective in increasing the accuracy of sleep perception and in reducing sleep-related anxiety and distress. Collectively, the correlational and experimental evidence derived from this programme of research have (1) provided empirical support for the cognitive arousal account, physiological account and the monitoring for sleep-related threat account of distorted perception of sleep in insomnia and (2) highlighted the potential benefits of widening the treatment focus from mainly attempting to increase the amount of sleep obtained to tackling the cognitive processes (e.g. worrying, monitoring for sleep-related threat, distorted perception of sleep etc.) that maintain insomnia (Harvey, 2002).","Copyright - Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.

The first aim of the current study was to determine the degree of congruency or differences between actigraphy and diary estimates of time spent trying to fall asleep and total time spent asleep. The second aim was to determine how individual differences in sleep quality, depressive and anxious symptoms, and memory would be associated with the difference between actigraphy and sleep diary estimates of sleep. The last aim was to determine whether the effect of sleep disturbance, depression, or anxiety on the discrepancy between the two measures was dependent on age. Our results demonstrated that participants perceived taking longer to fall asleep and sleeping more than what was indicated from an objective measure of their sleep. We found that worse sleep quality predicted a greater incongruence between self-reported and actigraphy estimated sleep onset latency. Future studies should continue to investigate how psychological and physiological functioning and processes impacts the discrepancy between self-reported and actigraphy estimated sleep in older adults and explore the longitudinal pattern of this discrepancy.","Copyright - Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.

(The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2008-06373-007). Primary insomnia (PI) is characterized by low subjective sleep quality which cannot always be verified using polysomnography (PSG). To shed light on this discrepancy, subjective estimates of sleep and PSG variables were compared in patients with PI and good sleeper controls (GSC). 100 patients with PI (age: 42.57 +/- 12.50 years, medication free for at least 14 days) and 100 GSC (41.12 +/- 13.99 years) with a sex distribution of 46 men and 54 women in each group were included. Both PSG and questionnaire variables showed clear impairments of sleep quality in PI compared with GSC. The arousal index within total sleep time was increased, which was mainly because of a strong increase within rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Subjectively, more PI than GSC subjects estimated wake times longer than obtained from PSG. Linear modeling analysis of subjective wake time in terms of PSG parameters revealed that in addition to PSG defined wake time, REM sleep time contributed significantly to subjective wake time. This REM sleep contribution was larger for PI than for GSC subjects. The findings suggest that REM sleep-related processes might contribute to subjectively disturbed sleep and the perception of waking time in patients with PI.

(The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2020-70662-001). RationaleThe mechanisms underlying impaired sleep quality in insomnia are not fully known, but an important role for sleep fragmentation has been proposed.ObjectivesThe aim of this study is to explore potential mechanisms of sleep fragmentation influencing alterations of perceived sleep quality.MethodsWe analyzed polysomnography (PSG) recordings from a double-blind crossover study with zopiclone 7.5 mg and placebo, in elderly participants with insomnia complaints and age-matched healthy controls. We compared survival dynamics of sleep and wake across group and treatment. Subsequently, we used a previously proposed model to estimate the amount of sleep onset latency (SOL) misperception from PSG-defined sleep fragmentation. Self-reported and model-estimated amount of SOL misperception were compared across group and treatment, as well as model prediction errors.ResultsIn the zopiclone night, the average segment length of NREM sleep was increased (group F = 1.16, p = 0.32; treatment F = 8.89, p< 0.01; group x treatment F = 0.44, p = 0.65), while the segment length of wake was decreased (group F = 1.48, p = 0.23; treatment F = 11.49, p< 0.01; group x treatment F = 0.36, p = 0.70). The self-reported and model-estimated amount of SOL misperception were lower during the zopiclone night (self-reported group F = 6.08, p< 0.01, treatment F = 10.8, p< 0.01, group x treatment F = 2.49, p = 0.09; model-estimated F = 1.70, p = 0.19, treatment F = 16.1, p< 0.001, group x treatment F = 0.60, p = 0.55). The prediction error was not altered (group F = 1.62, p = 0.20; treatment F = 0.20, p = 0.65; group x treatment F = 1.01, p = 0.37).ConclusionsImpaired subjective sleep quality is associated with decreased NREM stability, together with increased stability of wake. Furthermore, we conclude that zopiclone-induced changes in SOL misperception can be largely attributed to predictable changes of sleep architecture.

Saunders, Penn State University, College of Medicine, Hershey, PA, United States","Background: Sleep disturbance is common in bipolar disorder (BD) and can be a trigger for mood episodes. Treatment decisions are made in the clinic based on selfreported sleep duration, bedtime and waketime. However, BD may influence a patient's perception of sleep. In primary insomnia, objective short sleep duration (i.e., o 6h) is associated with cardiometabolic morbidity and mortality, while sleep misperception is associated with increased depression and anxiety. We aim to describe patterns of sleep misperception in BD. Method(s): BD (n=27 and HC (n=23) subjects wore an actigraph for one week on the non-dominant wrist and simultaneously filled out a sleep log. Subjects were given a diagnostic interview, the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, the Young Mania Rating Scale, and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. Actigraphic sleep variables were computed with ActiLife, v. 6.4.5. A discrepancy variable was calculated by subtracting objective sleep duration from subjective report of sleep duration on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, with negative values indicating underestimation and positive values indicating overestimation of objective sleep duration. Result(s): More subjects who underestimated (88%) or overestimated (68%) the amount of sleep by an hour or more were in the BD group than the HC group, and more subjects who were accurate estimators were in the HC group (65%). Mean total sleep time did not differ between sleep discrepancy groups in HC. In contrast, mean total sleep time was 8.1+/-1.0 for accurate estimators, 6.6+/-1.0 h for underestimators, and 5.5+/-1.6 for overestimators (p<0.01) in BD. Both under- and overestimators had higher depression scores than accurate estimators (p=0.03). Conclusion(s): Sleep misperception is very common in BD, particularly the overestimation of sleep time. In those with BD who misperceived their sleep, sleep duration was shorter and depression was greater. Given that patients with BD report sleep disturbances both during and between mood episodes and that sleep disturbances predict impending episodes, objective measures of sleep should become part of their clinical assessment.

Theoretically, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients may also exhibit sleep discrepancy due to sleep disruption. In this study we want to determine the discrepancy between subjective and objective sleep parameters in OSA. Method(s): Patients diagnosed with OSA from July 2014 till July 2015 at Excellence Center for Sleep Disorders at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand, age more than 18 years old were included in this retrospective study. Patients who had other sleep disorder besides OSA including periodic limb movement disorders, insomnia, sleep bruxism, and parasomnia were excluded from the study Results: Total of 514 patients were included in this study. The baseline demographic data showed that the sample population was 58.4% male with mean age of 52.6 +/- 15.5 years. The mean Epworth sleepiness scale score was 10.0 +/- 4.9 and the mean apnea hypopnea index and respiratory disturbance index was 38.8 +/- 26.7 and 41.2 +/- 25.9; respectively. Paired comparison of self-reported versus polysomnography-reported sleep parameters showed that there were statistically significant difference in mean sleep latency (minutes) 62.5 +/- 75.3 vs 13.7 +/- 21.5 (p < 0.001), mean total sleep time (minutes) 347.7 +/- 97.9 vs 369.4 +/- 64.0 (p < 0.001) and mean sleep efficiency (%) 77.9 +/- 20.3 vs 83.3 +/- 13.1 (p < 0.001). Overall the patient accurately predicted their sleep latency (to be within 30 minutes or not) in 59.1%, their total sleep time (<30 minutes discrepancy) in 31.3%, and their sleep efficiency (to be at least 85% or not) in 63.6%. Conclusion(s): Our result showed that obstructive sleep apnea patients tend to overestimate their sleep onset latency, underestimate their total sleep time and underestimate their sleep efficiency.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,"adult;apnea hypopnea index;*apnea monitoring;bruxism;controlled study;demography;diagnosis;*Epworth sleepiness scale;female;hospital;human;insomnia;major clinical study;male;middle aged;parasomnia;polysomnography;respiratory disturbance index;retrospective study;*sleep disordered breathing;sleep quality;sleep time;Thailand;young adult;Sleep Apnea Syndromes;Sleep Apnea, Obstructive",,,,Discrepancy between subjective and objective sleep parameters in obstructive sleep apnea patients,,Thailand,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"TST, SOL, SE",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Unknown ""self-reported""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Auerbach, University at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, United States","Introduction: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is highly associated with disordered sleep, which may moderate debilitating symptoms of this disease. There are several methods for evaluating sleep, including self-reported sleep diary and objective actigraphy, however few studies have examined the agreement between these measures in MS. Understanding this relationship may provide insight into perception of sleep that guides intervention. This study assessed concordance between subjective (sleep diary) and objective (actigraphy) measures of sleep duration (total sleep time, TST) and sleep efficiency (SE) in adults with MS. Method(s): Adults with relapsing-remitting MS wore actigraphy watches and kept sleep diaries for seven days. Concordance between diary and actigraphy measures of TST and SE was assessed using Bland-Altman analysis and Lin's concordance correlation (rc). Result(s): Data from thirty adults with MS (mean =45.5 years) was included. TST (actigraphy mean =290 min, SD=87; diary mean =477 min, SD=59; p<0.001) and SE (actigraphy mean= 58%, SD=16; diary mean= 95%, SD=4; p<0.001) differed significantly by sleep measure. Poor concordance between subjective and objective measures of TST and SE was also shown using concordance analysis (TST rc= 0.062, 95% CI= -0.023 - 0.145; SE rc= 0.006, 95% CI = -0.023 - 0.034). Bland-Altman analysis showed fixed bias in overestimation of TST and SE using diary versus actigraphy, and proportional bias with patterns of disagreement in TST and SE where shorter sleep duration showed greater differences between sleep measures. Conclusion(s): These findings suggest poor concordance between subjective and objective measures of sleep duration and sleep efficiency among adults with MS. This discordance favors overestimation of sleep duration and sleep efficiency using diary over actigraphy in general, but also greater differences between measures when sleep duration was shorter. These results may reflect lack of insight into sleep that should be further characterized.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,actimetry;adult;clinical article;controlled study;female;human;male;*multiple sclerosis;remission;*sleep quality;sleep time;conference abstract;Multiple Sclerosis,,,,Discordance between subjective and objective measures of sleep among adults with multiple sclerosis,,Netherlands,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"TST, SE",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Sleep diary,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Barreto, Neurology, Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil","Introduction: Sleep State Misperception (SSM) is the current diagnostic term for the intriguing group of insomnia patients who appear unable to discriminate sleep from wakefulness. Historically it has been among the most challenging to understand and manage clinically. According to International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD), SSM, recently renamed 'Paradoxical Insomnia', is a disorder in which a complaint of severe insomnia occurs without objective evidence of sleep disturbance, and without a significant impairment of daytime function. The present study aims to identify psychosocial features of patients with SSM. Method(s): We studied SSM patients from the Neuro-Sono Sleep Center, Department of Neurology, Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo, Brazil. Semi structured interviews were conducted following a script of questions about birthplace, family, childhood, sleep, moves, present life and perceptions. We performed content analysis on the interviews searching interviewees' feelings, thoughts, and social and familiar insertion. Result(s): In this study, we identified 60 patients (33 females, 23 to 76 years old) with confirmed SSM diagnosis among 2000 medical files and 1735 PSG studies. We observed that 80% was not native of Sao Paulo City. The severity of the nocturnal complaint is not matched by evidence for pathologic sleepiness, marked performance decrements, and other severe functional impairments during the day that typical in cases of such marked sleep deprivation. Sleep stages 1 and 2 were longer than among people without such complaints. We observed one autoimmune disease and two syndromes affecting perception. Data of 20 interviews revealed similar features of these patients: unsafe and threatened environment, uprooting feelings, complacence and methodical behavior; proactivity, resilience, rootlessness; and, recurrent feelings of loss and grief. These patients related concerns about long-term effects of their perceived sleep deficits on general health and longevity. Conclusion(s): Psychosocial features of SSM patients are important information to diagnosis and for the treatment, which could potentially help determine a psychological and clinical profile of SSM patients. We suspect that the psychosocial features disclosed in our study are not restricted to Brazilian culture, but probably to a broader trait of patients with SSM, granting equivalent studies in different cultures.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,*patient;*sleep;*insomnia;*health care organization;diagnosis;sleep disorder;interview;sleep deprivation;sleep stage;autoimmune disease;environment;grief;health;wakefulness;classification;neurology;Brazil;longevity;birthplace;childhood;content analysis;female;city;somnolence;functional disease;semi structured interview;Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders,,,,Psychosocial features of brazilian patients with paradoxical insomnia,,Brasil,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Sleep diary,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our objective is to link misperception to sleep severity, beliefs and attitudes and personality measures between insomnia individuals (INS) classified as paradoxical insomnia (PARA-I) or psychophysiological insomnia (PSY-I) and good sleepers (GS). Method(s): 122 individuals [(50 GS; MAge: 34.7, SD = 1.29); (72 INS; 42 PSY-I; MAge: 40.2, SD = 1.4 and 30 PARA-I; MAge: 40.0, SD = 1.7)] spent four nights in the laboratory. BDI, BAI, ISI, DBAS and NEO-FFI were completed. Difference scores were obtained by subtracting subjective (diary) from objective (PSG) measures of SOL, WASO and TST. Four misperception categories were created: A) <=30 min; B) between 30 and 60 min; C) between 60 and 90 min and D) more than 90 min. Result(s): Significant correlations were obtained for GS on Extraversion (WASO-B, r = 0.42) and Openness (SOL-B, r = 0.41). For INS, significant correlations were obtained for SOL-B and BAI (r = -0.30), BDI (r = -0.30), ISI (-0.32) and WASO-B and DBAS scores (-0.25).When INS were subdivided, associations were found for PSY-I for DBAS (WASO-C = 0.38), BDI (SOL-C = 0.38) and Conscientiousness (SOL-C = 0.32) while for PARA-I, they were DBAS and BDI (SOL-C = -0.57 and 0.55) and Conscientiousness (SOLC = -0.44 and WASO-C = -0.53). Conclusion(s): Results suggest that correlates of sleep misperception appear especially for WASO, only once it exceeds 60 min. In addition, they differ for GS and INS, albeit be PSY-I or PARA-I. All questionnaires, to a certain extent, could be helpful at targeting sleep misperception.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,*sleep;*society;insomnia;laboratory;questionnaire;extraversion;night;personality;Sleep,,,,Correlates of sleep misperception,,Canada,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"TST, SOL, WASO",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Sleep diary,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Boardman, Monash University, Notting Hill, Australia","Introduction: Insomnia Disorder (INS) is generally characterised by an objective-subjective discrepancy in total sleep time (TST), where INS underestimate objectively-measured TST. Similarly, diagnostic criteria require INS to report impaired daytime functioning, and this often relates to cognition. However, there is no consistent evidence of objective cognitive deficits in INS. This apparent objective-subjective discrepancy in cognitive performance suggests INS may be characterised by a cognitive performance misperception (CPM), just as it is characterised by a sleep state misperception. No prior research has directly examined if INS can accurately assess performance on a specific cognitive task. In the present study, we did just that, for a working memory task. Method(s): Twenty-five good sleepers (GS; 12 F, Mean Age = 32.4 +/- 7.1) and 25 patients with DSM-IV primary insomnia (INS; 12 F, Mean Age =32.3 +/- 7.2) participated. Participants wore an actigraph for one week while completing a daily sleep diary. Sleep state (mis)perception was calculated as the average daily deviation between actigraphy and diary-based TST. At the end of the week, participants completed an N-back task with 4 levels (0-,1-,2-,3-back). Objective performance was measured as task accuracy. Subjective performance was measured as self-reported accuracy. Cognitive performance (mis)perception was calculated as the deviation between objective/subjective accuracy. Result(s): GSs overestimated actigraphy-based TST, while INS underestimated TST (p<0.0001). All participants showed CPM: they underestimated task performance on 2-back and 3-back (accuracy modality x difficulty interaction, p < 0.001). However, the interaction between CPM and Group was not significant (p = 0.463), indicating CPM did not differ between GSs and those with INS. Discussion(s): As expected, INS showed sleep state misperception, underestimating their daily TST. Surprisingly, though, INS did not show a cognitive performance misperception different to GSs. This finding is inconsistent with the-objective-subjective discrepancy-in cognitive performance described in the literature. This may be because diagnostic interviews do not ask patients about performance on specific cognitive tasks where performance can be verified. Thus, subjective cognitive deficits may instead reflect actual real-world deficits (i.e., there is no discrepancy with correct measurements).","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,actigraph;adult;clinical article;cognitive defect;controlled study;diagnosis;diagnostic test accuracy study;DSM-IV;female;human;interview;male;n-back test;perception;*primary insomnia;sleep time;task performance;working memory;conference abstract;Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders;Cognition,,,,Cognitive performance misperception in patients with insomnia disorder,,Netherlands,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,TST,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Sleep diary,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBTI) effectively improves insomnia symptoms, but whether it reduces subjective-objective sleep discrepancy is not well understood. This study examined whether CBT-I reduces subjective-objective sleep discrepancy against a control condition, and explored associations between changes in discrepancy and changes in sleep-related attitudes. Method(s): Participants were 112 (age M+/-SD=47.1 +/- 12.3, 67.9% female) adults with comorbid insomnia and major depressive disorder from the TRIAD (Treatment of Insomnia and Depression) study. They were randomized to 7-session CBT-I or control interventions to augment antidepressant pharmacotherapy over 16 weeks. 2-week actigraphy and sleep diary were collected at baseline, in the middle, and at the end of the trial. Subjective-objective sleep discrepancy was operationalised as the discrepancy between self-report and actigraphy time-in-bed (TIB), total sleep time (TST), sleep onset latency (SOL), and wake after sleep onset (WASO). The Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep Scale (DBAS) was administered at baseline and mid-intervention. Result(s): At baseline, self-report TIB and TST were significantly shorter, whilst SOL and WASO longer than those from actigraphy. Multilevel models using daily data showed that after controlling for age and sex, the CBT-I group showed significantly greater reduction in subjective-objective sleep discrepancy in all (except TIB) domains compared to the control group (all p-values<.01). Improvements were evident from mid-intervention. The differential effects of the two interventions on the overall reduction of subjective-objective sleep discrepancy in TST, SOL, and SE (but not WASO) was significantly associated with changes in DBAS from baseline to mid-intervention (all p-values<.05). Conclusion(s): CBT-I was effective in reducing the subjective-objective sleep discrepancy in patients with comorbid insomnia and major depression. Improvements in subjective-objective sleep discrepancy was associated with improved sleep-related attitudes, a therapeutic target of CBT-I.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,"*actimetry;adult;clinical study;*cognitive behavioral therapy;control group;controlled clinical trial;controlled study;drug therapy;female;human;*insomnia;*major depression;male;randomized controlled trial;*self report;*sleep quality;sleep time;statistical model;statistical significance;antidepressant agent;Comorbidity;Depressive Disorder;Depressive Disorder, Major;Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders;Cognition",,,,Cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia reduces the discrepancy between actigraphy and self-report estimates of sleep quality and quantity in comorbid insomnia and major depressive disorders,,Netherlands,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"TIB, TST, SOL, WASO",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Sleep diary,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Castelnovo, Ospedale Regionale Di Lugano (EOC), Lugano, Switzerland","Objectives/Introduction: Misperception is definitively the most intriguing yet challenging feature of insomnia. After decades of debate, the scientific sleep community is still critically divided between who considers the underestimation of sleep duration a typical feature of all insomniacs, with some extreme cases being part of a clinical continuum, and who supports the existence of a separate diagnostic category, namely ""subjective insomnia"", otherwise known as ""paradoxical insomnia"" (PI). Most of the debate is fuelled by the lack of a consensus on which should be a quantitative definition of sleep state misperception and by the absence of evidence-based strategies to study and define paradoxical insomnia. Method(s): We conducted a systematic review of the literature and extracted 20 different quantitative definitions of PI. We then applied these definitions to two real-world datasets. The first consisted of 200 chronic primary insomnia patients, diagnosed according to DSM-IV-TR criteria, the second of 200 age- and gender matched healthy controls without insomnia. For each dataset, available data from the objective sleep parameters and their subjective estimation were imported and analysed in MATLAB using custom algorithms. Finally, we identified some basic, fundamental features a quantitative definition of PI must respect and applied them to our 20 definitions. Result(s): Prevalence of PI according to the 20 selected definitions ranged from 8 to 66% in insomnia patients, and from 0 to 89% in healthy controls. Overlap between definitions ranged from 3 to 84%. We ranked classworthy the available definitions. Only three fulfilled our new proposed quantitative criteria for PI, and several open issues remains, like whether there is a minimum number of hours an insomnia patient should sleep in order to be defined as paradoxical, and whether SOL can be used in the definition of paradoxical insomnia together with TST. Conclusion(s): Given the high heterogeneity of quantitative definitions of paradoxical insomnia, the scarce literature on the topic is of little use. We suggest to adopt only the definitions that survived a rigorous methodological evaluation and use them when studying the phenomenon until a consensus is reached. A research agenda is proposed at the end of the paper.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,"adult;consensus;controlled study;data analysis software;diagnosis;DSM-IV-TR;female;gender;human;male;prevalence;*primary insomnia;quantitative analysis;sleep parameters;systematic review;conference abstract;Sleep Disorders, Intrinsic;Sleep, REM;Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders;Sleep",,,,The paradoxes of sleep state misperception and of paradoxical insomnia: A search for an evidence-based definition,,USA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chan, Department of Psychiatry, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Lebanon, NH, United States","Introduction: Individuals with primary insomnia often have poorer subjective sleep than objective sleep, a phenomenon termed negative sleep discrepancy. Recent studies suggest that this phenomenon might differ in comorbid insomnia. This study examined sleep discrepancy, its night-to-night variability, and its demographic, clinical, and behavioral correlates in adults with comorbid insomnia and fibromyalgia. Method(s): Sleep diaries and actigraphy were obtained from 223 adults with fibromyalgia and insomnia (age=51.53 [SD=11.90] years; 93% women) for 14 consecutive days. Sleep discrepancy was calculated by subtracting diary from actigraphy estimates of sleep onset latency (SOL-D), wake after sleep onset (WASO-D), and total sleep time (TST-D) for each night. Averages across 14 days were calculated for each individual. Night-to-night variability in sleep discrepancy was calculated by taking the within-individual standard deviation over 14 days. Participants also completed measures of mood, pain, fatigue, sleep/pain medications, nap duration, and caffeine consumption. Result(s): Average sleep discrepancies across 14 days were small (SOL-D: 7.91 mins; WASO-D: -8.32 mins; TST: 1.04 mins). However, absolute discrepancies per night were large ([SOL-D]: 44.15 mins; [WASO-D]: 32.09 mins; [TST-D]: 83.02 mins). Bland Altman plots showed that there was no consistent positive or negative discrepancy for the sleep parameters examined. The direction of sleep discrepancy varies by day and is equally likely to be either positive or negative. Night-to-night variability in sleep discrepancy was high; within-individual night-to-night variability was greater than between-individual variability. Taking prescribed pain medications, primarily opioids, was associated with greater night-to-night variability in WASO-D and TST-D. Conclusion(s): Unlike patients with primary insomnia, patients with comorbid fibromyalgia do not exhibit consistent negative sleep discrepancy. Absolute sleep discrepancies per night were large, but positive and negative sleep discrepancies over 14 days canceled each other, resulting fairly concordant diary and actigraphy estimates of sleep. Future research is needed to investigate the clinical significance and implications of high night-to-night variability of sleep discrepancy, and the role of prescribed opioid medications in sleep perception.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,actimetry;adult;controlled study;drug therapy;fatigue;female;*fibromyalgia;human;major clinical study;male;mood;night;perception;*primary insomnia;sleep latency;*sleep time;caffeine;opiate;conference abstract;Comorbidity;Fibromyalgia;Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders,,,,Correlates of subjective-objective sleep discrepancy in patients with comorbid fibromyalgia and insomnia,,USA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"TST, SOL, WASO",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Sleep diary,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Method(s): A total of 250 consecutive primary insomniacs without other comorbid sleep disorders, aged 18 or older whose objective total sleep time (TST) was more than 120 min were enrolled. We divided these subjects into a misperception group and non-misperception group. SSM is defined as those whose objective TST was more than 6.5 h, sleep efficiency was at least 85%, as well as underestimating one's TST by more than 60 min in subjectively reported TSTs, compared to the objective TST of the PSG. All subjects underwent an over-night PSG and completed sleep related and psychiatric measurements. Result(s): The prevalence of the SSM was 26.4%. The misperception group was significantly younger than the non-misperception group (47.48 +/- 12.63 vs. 54.24 +/- 11.32, P < 0.001). Thus we adjusted age as a covariate in the data. There were no significant differences in sleep related and psychiatric measurement results between the misperception group and non-misperception group but the scores of both groups were abnormal compared with the norm. Comparing the PSG variables, the misperception group showed significantly longer TST, shorter sleep latency, and better sleep efficiency. Conclusion(s): Although the subjects with SSM were almost normal in objective sleep variables, they subjectively complain of insomnia and poor quality of sleep. In the misperception group there were some psychiatric problems, including mild depressive and anxiety symptoms.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,*human;*primary insomnia;*Korea;*sleep;*society;*patient;prevalence;night;sleep time;insomnia;sleep disorder;anxiety;Korea;Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders,,,,Clinical characteristics of patients with primary insomnia in Korea: Comparing the misperception group and nonmisperception group,,Korea,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Unknown ""subjective""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Method(s): Twenty seven individuals with primary insomnia [mean age = 48; n female = 22; baseline Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) = 19] completed a 4-week sleep restriction treatment. We analysed the discrepancy between subjective total sleep time (TST, sleep diaries) and objective TST (actigraphy). A misperception index (MI) was computed [(objective TST - subjective TST)/objective TST], ranging from -1 to +1, with positive values indicating a greater underestimation of objective sleep. Result(s): The treatment intervention produced significant reductions in ISI scores from baseline (mean = 19) to post-treatment (mean = 12, P < 0.01). The MI was found to vary across the weeks of treatment, [F (1.7, 45.3)=6.8, P = 0.004], significantly decreasing from week 1 (+0.11, SD = 0.17) to week 4 [+0.02 (SD = 0.17), P = 0.006]. This change in misperception occurred despite no changes to objective sleep over treatment, (P = 0.15), while subjective total sleep time significantly improved from 260 (week 1) to 303 (week 4) min (P < 0.01). Visual presentation of MI across day of therapy indicated a strong negative correlation, with progression through SRT being associated with a decline in MI (r = -0.7). Conclusion(s): Misperception of total sleep time, at least when evaluated against actigraphy, appears to reduce across SRT. Although this report lacks pre-treatment actigraphy data, these results may indicate that sleep restriction exerts some of its effectsthrough a reduction in subjective-objective sleep discrepancies.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,*sleep;*sleep time;*society;*actimetry;*insomnia;therapy;female;Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders;Sleep,,,,Sleep misperception in insomnia: Changes in the discrepancy between actigraphy and self-reported total sleep time during a 4-week sleep restriction intervention,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, the concurrent examination of both measurement strategies, while rarely done, is important because improvement in one domain may not be paralleled by improvement in the other domain. Metaanalytic data were used to assess the association of subjective and objective treatment outcomes by drug class. Method(s): PubMed searches, from 1967-June 2016, yielded 327 possible articles of RCTs evaluating BZs, BZRAs, SADs, DORAs, or melatonin agonists (MELA). Weighted effect sizes (ES) were computed for the pre-post change data and were compared to the study placebo condition. Between measurement strategy differences were assessed using ES difference scores. Note: positive values favor sleep diary outcomes and negative values favor PSG outcomes. Result(s): Sufficient data were available for only BZRAs, SADs, DORAs, and MELA. When examining subjective-objective ES difference scores the following was observed: SL (BZRAs = 0.04; SADs = 0.02; DORAs = -0.03; MELA = -0.14); WASO (MELA = 0.03; BZRAs = -0.01; DORAs = -0.17; SADs = -0.26); and TST (BZRAs = 0.03; SADs = -0.03; DORAs = -0.10; MELA = -0.11). Conclusion(s): These preliminary results indicate that, overall, BZRAs produce the most concordant results on PSG and self-report measures (when taking into account placebo responding). The most discordant results, overall, were found with the DORAs and MELA, although the single most discordant value was for SADs on WASO. In each of these cases, PSG measures were found to show greater levels of efficacy. Given that subjective and objective treatment gains may reflect different benefits to the patient, discordance need not be viewed as better or worse efficacy. This said, medications that disproportionately affect objective measures may not be viewed favorably by patients and this may, in turn, adversely affect treatment adherence.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,agonist;controlled study;effect size;female;human;male;Medline;self report;sleep;systematic review;*hypnotic agent;melatonin;placebo;Treatment Outcome;Hypnotics and Sedatives,,,,Subjective-objective discrepancies in treatment outcome with four types of hypnotics: A first pass analysis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Symptoms assessed via sleep diaries and actigraphy often produce discrepant findings. This study examined whether opioid dose and patient age interact in predicting the magnitude or direction of discrepancy between diary and actigraphy sleep outcomes in adults with fibromyalgia. Method(s): Participants (N=199, 18-77 years of age, M=51.5, SD=11.7) with comorbid fibromyalgia and insomnia completed 14 days of sleep diary and actigraphy. Daily opioid dose was converted to lowest recommend dosage units. Multiple regressions determined whether average opioid dose and its interaction with age predicted magnitude or direction of discrepancy between sleep diary and actigraphy measurements of sleep onset latency (SOL), wake after sleep onset (WASO), and sleep efficiency (SE). Patient sex, use of sleep medication, evening pain, and total sleep time were entered as covariates. Result(s): Greater opioid dose predicted greater magnitude of discrepancy in SOL (B=6.10, SE=2.29, p=.008) and SE (B=1.92, SE=.70, p=.007). Opioid dose interacted with age to predict direction of discrepancy in SOL (B=.88, SE=.27, p=.001) and SE (B=-.17 SE=.08, p=.03). For SOL, greater opioid dose predicted longer actigraphy than diary estimates in younger patients (B=-11.02, SE=4.65, p=.02), longer diary than actigraphy estimates in older patients (B=9.09, SE=3.66, p=.01), and was not a predictor in middle-aged patients. For SE, greater opioid dose predicted larger diary than actigraphy estimates in younger patients (B=3.27, SE=1.36 p=.02) and was not a predictor in older/middle-aged patients. Opioid dose did not predict magnitude or direction of WASO discrepancies. Conclusion(s): Results suggest that in patients with fibromyalgia, the magnitude of diary and actigraphy SOL/SE discrepancies may increase as a function of opioid dose, and the direction of discrepancies may depend on patient age. We speculate that increased opioid use combined with age-related factors such as cognitive decline and increased health problems may impact perceived sleep.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,"*actimetry;adult;aged;cognitive defect;drug therapy;female;*fibromyalgia;human;insomnia;low drug dose;major clinical study;male;middle aged;multiple regression;sleep latency;*sleep quality;sleep time;*opiate;conference abstract;Analgesics, Opioid;Fibromyalgia;Sleep",,,,Sleep diary vs actigraphy based outcomes in adults with fibromyalgia: Do opioid dose and age predict discrepancies?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The frequency and the determinants of sleep misperception in general population samples are unknown. Recent studies showed that objective sleep duration may be a useful marker in phenotyping insomniacs. In this study we examined the role of objective sleep duration and psychological profiles on sleep misperception in a large, general population sample. Method(s): 142 insomniacs and 724 controls selected from the Penn State Adult Sleep Cohort a general random sample of 1,741 individuals (age >= 20 years) were studied in the sleep lab, completed the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, and were split into two groups based on their objective sleep duration: ""normal sleep duration"" (>= 6 hours) and ""short sleep duration"" (< 6 hours). Result(s): Insomniacs with normal sleep duration, in contrast to their respective controls, underestimated their sleep duration, whereas insomniacs with short sleep duration, similarly to their respective controls, overestimated their sleep duration. Insomniacs with normal sleep duration showed high depression and anxiety, and low ego strength, whereas insomniacs with short sleep duration showed emotional distress commonly associated with medical disorders. Conclusion(s): Underestimation of sleep duration is prevalent among insomniacs with objective normal sleep duration but not in those with short sleep duration. Anxious-ruminative traits and poor resources for coping with stress appear to mediate the underestimation of sleep duration. These data further support the clinical utility and validity of objective sleep measures in phenotyping insomnia.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,*sleep;*insomnia;*health care organization;population;phenotype;adult;emotional stress;Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory;anxiety;ego strength;coping behavior;validity;diagnosis;random sample;marker;Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders;Sleep,,,,Sleep misperception in chronic insomnia: The role of objective sleep duration and psychological profiles,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unsurprisingly, research has highlighted sleep as an important facilitator of healthy neurocognitive development (Scher, 2008). Reported sleep quality is an integral part of sleep science, e.g. subjective sleep quality is related to cognitive performance in older adults (Nebes et al. 2009). Assessing sleep quality in infants is challenging as infants are unable to report on their sleep quality and subjective parent-report alone is not reliable (Sadeh, 1996). Actigraphy can be used as an objective measure. This study examines completion rates and agreement between sleep questionnaires, a sleep diary and actigraphy in assessing habitual sleep patterns and quality, including sleep duration, fragmentation and circadian rhythm. Our main objective is to determine the extent to which subjective sleep measures coincide with each other and with the objective actigraphy measure, and to consider the implications for neurocognitive development. Material(s) and Method(s): This study is part of a larger longitudinal study (up to 4 study visits/participant) exploring the relationship between sleep and early neurocognitive development. For this poster, N=65 (with 140 individual study visits) typically developing infants were studied (age: 4-14 months). The subjective measures were the Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire (BISQ; Sadeh, 2004), the Sleep and Settle Questionnaire (SSQ; Matthey, 2001) and a 7-days sleep diary and the objective measure was actigraphy (w-GT3X-BT, ActiGraph Corp.). 1) Completion rates for each measure and 2) agreement (using correlational analyses and Bland-Altman plots) between measures were investigated. Systematic differences that might explain agreement/completion or lack thereof were examined. In a first proof-of-concept step, the agreement within the subjective measures (SSQ/BISQ) for the above-mentioned sleep variables was investigated. Study data collection due for completion by February 2019. Result(s): To date, results show that parents were more likely to fill out the BISQ (90.48 % fully completed, 8.57% partially completed) vs. SSQ (73.81% fully completed, 20% partially completed). Initial examination of subjective sleep measures yielded surprising results. For example, BISQ and SSQ showed moderate correlations for night time sleep duration (r =.35, p=.001) and day time sleep duration (r=.3, p=.001). Visual examination of the data showed no patterns regarding overall sleep duration assessed by SSQ/BISQ. Further analyses including overall completion and comparison with actigraphy and the sleep diary will be presented. Conclusion(s): This poster shows that different sleep measures for assessing sleep in the first year of life vary in their agreement and completion rates. Ramifications for sleep quality assessment and cross-study comparisons as well as the relation of sleep quality and neurocognitive development will be discussed.

Hermans, Department of Electrical Engineering, Eindhoven University of Technology, Eindhoven, Netherlands","Objectives/Introduction: Insomnia patients often overestimate their sleep onset latency (SOL). The mechanism underlying this type of sleep state misperception is not fully understood. We hypothesize that the length of uninterrupted sleep fragments after sleep onset influences the perception of the SOL because too short sleep fragments might be overlooked. We attempt to make a model of the minimum length that a sleep fragment should have in order to be perceived as sleep, and we fit the model to subjective data of insomniacs and healthy controls. Method(s): Standard in-lab polysomnographic recordings were performed in 20 elderly, untreated insomniacs and 21 age-matched selfdefined good sleepers. Recordings were visually scored according to R&K criteria. In the model sleep onset was defined as the first epoch of the first sleep fragment longer than L minutes, with L varying from 0.5 to 40. We selected the length L that resulted in the smallest Mean Square Error (MSE) of the difference between modelled SOL and SOL perceived by the subject. This was done for both subject groups separately. Result(s): For insomniacs, the lowest MSE was found for a length L of 30 min (MSE without model: 7195 vs. L = 30: 3927). In the healthy subjects, applying the model only resulted in small improvements of the MSE. The lowest MSE was found for L = 10 (MSE without model: 1185 vs. L = 10: 969), although the results for all model parameters L below 20 were very similar. Conclusion(s): The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanisms underlying sleep onset misperception, by modelling the influence of sleep interruption on subjective SOL. The results indicate that in insomnia patients the perception of sleep onset can be influenced if a sleep fragment is interrupted after less than 30 min. The different results for the two groups suggest that, for the perception of sleep onset, insomniacs are more sensitive to sleep interruption than healthy subjects. In order to extend our findings to the general population, the analysis should be repeated in different age groups. Additionally, other parameters could be added to the model, for instance sleep depth and the duration of the sleep disruption.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,"aged;animal experiment;animal model;controlled study;female;groups by age;*insomnia;male;nonhuman;perception;population;sleep latency;conference abstract;Sleep Disorders, Intrinsic",,,,Modelling sleep state misperception at sleep onset,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, its role and change during treatment remain unclear. The present study aimed to assess the effect of cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) on subjective and objective sleep discrepancy of total sleep time (TST), sleep onset latency (SOL) and wake after sleep onset (WASO). The TST discrepancy was assessed across the entire therapy. The second aim was to examine the treatment outcome of two insomnia groups differing in sleep perception. Method(s): Thirty-six adults with insomnia (mean age = 46.7, SD = 13.9; 22 females) were enrolled in the final analyses. Patients underwent a 6-week group CBT-I programme. Sleep diary and actigraphy measurements were obtained during the therapy. Misperception index (MI = [objective TST-self-reported TST]/objective TST) was computed to differentiate patients who underestimated TST (n = 16; UN group) and patients who accurately perceived or overestimated TST (n = 20; A/O group). Result(s): After CBT-I, a significant decrease of TST (T = 6.95, p = 0.000, d = 1.16) and SOL (T = 199.50, p = 0.039, d = 0.47) discrepancy was observed without a change in the WASO discrepancy in the total sample. Only the UN group reported a decrease in SOL discrepancy after the treatment, whereas TST discrepancy significantly changed in both UN and A/O groups. The UN group showed a significant decrease in MI TST from Week 1 (0.14 +/- 0.08) to Week 2 (0.02 +/- 0.15; p = 0.048) when the sleep restriction was implemented, whereas the A/O group showed the first significant change at Week 4. The latter group tended to overestimate TST after the treatment. Conclusion(s): CBT-I was associated with a reduction of sleep discrepancies. Both groups differing in sleep perception responded similarly to CBT-I, although different CBT-I components could have a more significant effect in each group. Patients with insomnia who overestimate sleep quantity should be taken into account by future studies to explore whether the treatment effect is associated with more subtle objective sleep changes, or whether cognitive processes play a more important role in this group.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,actimetry;adult;clinical article;clinical assessment;*cognitive behavioral therapy;conference abstract;controlled study;female;human;*insomnia;middle aged;perception;*sleep latency;sleep time;Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders;Cognition;Sleep,,,,Changes of objective and subjective sleep discrepancy during and after the cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Kay, Clinical and Health Psychology, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, United States","Introduction: Discrepancy between subjective and objective measures of sleep increases with age and is associated with higher rates of late-life insomnia. The cause of age related sleep discrepancy (SD) is unclear, but as a potential mechanism of late-life insomnia, the consequences may be profound. Even occasional SD can be problematic when selfreported sleep onset latency (SOL) and wake after sleep onset (WASO) far exceed objective measurements of these events. This type of discrepancy (sometimes called sleep misperception), may contribute to negative evaluations of overall sleep and lead to protective behaviors that further disrupt sleep. Variables associated with SD in younger samples include caffeine consumption, bedtime, daytime sleepiness, depression, sleep complaint, and gender. The purpose of this study was to determine how these variables relate to SD in older adults. Method(s): 103 community dwelling older adults, Mage = 72.81(0.70), wore an Actiwatch-L(24hrs/day/2weeks) and concurrently completed sleep diaries. Daily values for actigraphically-measured SOL and WASO were subtracted from respective diary reports to calculate daily SD for SOL and WASO. Predictor variables were gender, sleep complaint status, caffeine consumption, bedtime, number of medical conditions, Epworth Sleepiness Scale score, and Beck Depression Inventory-II score. Result(s): Multilevel modeling (MLM) revealed that 1) SD decreased across 14 days, 2) earlier bedtime, female gender, and depression predicted greater SOLsd, and 3) caffeine consumption, daytime sleepiness, sleep complaint, and depression predicted greater WASOsd. Predictors explained 28% and 62% of the between-person variance in SOLsd and WASOsd, respectively. Conclusion(s): Extending research findings from younger adult samples, this is the first study to model SD among older adults. By investigating SOLsd and WASOsd separately, a more focused picture was obtained. Among older adults, SOLsd and WASOsd may have distinct predictors and consequences. Because the causal role of these predictors in relationship to SD has yet to be explained, further research is warranted.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,*sleep;*adult;*health care organization;gender;insomnia;daytime somnolence;multilevel analysis;latent period;female;model;community;predictor variable;Epworth sleepiness scale;Beck Depression Inventory;caffeine;Sleep,,,,Sleep discrepancy and its correlates among older adults,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Kay, Clinical and Health Psychology, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, United States","Introduction: Insomnia patients commonly misperceive sleep as wake-fulness. Compared to objective measures, they report protracted sleep onset latency (SOL) and wake after sleep onset (WASO). Sleep misperceptions (SM) may result from simultaneously high activation of sleep and arousal systems of the brain allowing self-awareness to occur during sleep. It is hypothesized health conditions associated with physiological and cognitive hyperarousal, expressly pain and depression complaints, will relate to greater SM, even in the absence of sleep complaint. Method(s): 103 community dwelling older adults (Mage=72.81, SD=7.12) wore Actiwatch-L (24hrs/day/2 weeks) and concurrently completed sleep diaries. Daily actigraphically-measured SOL and WASO were subtracted from respective diary measures to calculate average SM that occurred at SOL (SOLsm) and at WASO (WASOsm). A 2 (sleep complaint/ no sleep complaint) x 2 (pain complaint/no pain complain) MANCOVA was employed. Number of chronic health conditions, number of medications, and BDI-II scores were co-varied. SOLsm and WASOsm were the dependent variables. Result(s): The omnibus test was significant for depression [Wilks' LAMBDA=. 85,F(2,96)=8.75,p<.001,eta2=.15], pain [Wilks'LAMBDA=.94,F(2,96)=3.27, p<.01,eta2=.06], and sleep [Wilks'LAMBDA=.90,F(2.96)=5.22,p<.05,eta2=.10] complaint. Follow-up ANOVAs investigating SOLsm revealed a significant main effect for depression [F(1,97)=10.13,p<.01,eta2=.10] and sleep complaint [F(1,97)=6.00,p=.02,eta2=.06]; Follow-ANOVAs investigating WASOsm revealed a significant main effect for depression [F(1,8.17,p<.01,eta2=.08], sleep [F(1,97)=4.91,p<.05,eta2=.05], and pain [FQ,97)=5.55,p<.05,eta2=05] complaint. For SOL and WASO, the presence of depression, sleep, or pain complaint was related to greater SM. There were no significant interactions or effects for number of health complaints or medications. Conclusion(s): Results suggest that regardless of sleep complaint, pain and depression relate to SM. Hyperarousal during sleep that results in SM may induce a form of localized sleep deprivation in affective/ executive areas of the brain leading to localized daytime dysfunctions. SM research may help explain the underlying mechanisms to a variety of health conditions that predispose to and emerge from insomnia. Potential treatment implications are considered.

Kay, Clinical and Health Psychology, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, United States","Introduction: Late-life insomnia is a prevalent and serious health problem. Sleep misperception (SM), overestimating wake time while trying to sleep, predicts insomnia onset and maintenance. Like insomnia, sleep misperception increases with age. However, research on longitudinal patterns and correlates of SM among older adults is needed. We posit SM results from perceptual areas of the brain remaining awake during global sleep, reflecting a form of localized sleep deprivation. Thus, SM patterns may predict homeostatic sleep dysregulation, (e.g., sleep rebound). This study aims to-1) describe the longitudinal pattern of SM among older adults by contrasting the amounts of within- to between- person variability in SM; 2) compare SM that occurs during sleep onset latency (SOL) to SM that occurs during wake after sleep onset (WASO); and 3) determine if SM predicts longer total sleep time (TSTobjective) as a marker of homeostatic rebound. Method(s): 103 community dwelling older adults (Mage)=72.81,SD=7.12) wore an Actiwatch-L(24hrs/day/2weeks) and concurrently completed sleep diaries. Daily values for actigraphically-measured SOL and WASO were subtracted from respective diary reports to calculate daily SM for SOL and WASO. Result(s): Intraindividual variability analyses (IIV) and multilevel modeling (MLM) revealed-1) 50-85% of total variance in SM was within- persons, suggesting SM is an occasional event; 2) within-person, nights that SOL was greater than usual, WASO was less than usual [B=- .10,t(87.59)=-2.01,p<.05]. Interestingly, between-persons, those with greater SOL.sm had greater WASOsm [B=.21,t(98.91)=3.98,p<.001]; 3) within-persons, nights with increased SOLsm were related to longer TSTobjective [P=32,t(67.74)=5.02,p<.001]. Conclusion(s): SM is ubiquitous but highly variable among older adults. Individuals with higher average SOLsm had higher average WASO ;sm however, days individuals had higher WASOsm predicted lower SOL sm Finally, a homeostatic sleep rebound may explain the finding that increased TST occurred on days that SOL was greater than usual objective sm Understanding the variable but predictive patterns of SM may lead to new preventative and therapeutic insomnia interventions.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,*sleep;*adult;*health care organization;insomnia;night;sleep deprivation;latent period;community;sleep time;multilevel analysis;health;brain;marker;phosphorus 32,,,,Patterns and correlates of sleep misperception in older adults,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the frequency of SSM is unknown. The primary goal of this study was to investigate the frequency of SSM in OSA and speciically the proportion of those who under-perceive sleep time. Method(s): A retrospective review was performed on patients attending a sleep laboratory, January 1, 2010 through April 15, 2011. OSA was considered present if the apnea/hypopnea index (AHI) >=5. The ratio of subjective to objective total sleep time (TST), sleep-onset latency (SOL), and sleep eficiency (SE) was calculated and SSM was deined as any value +/-12.5% of the mean value for each parameter. The threshold of 12.5% was based upon an assumption that >1 hour of discrepancy per 8 hours of sleep is clinically signiicant. Three subgroups were deined for each sleep parameter: under-perception, no misperception and overperception. Result(s): The population included 302 subjects (64% male). Mean age was 50.2 +/- 13.2 years and mean BMI was 35.1+/-9.1 kg/m2. SSM was noted in 89.8%, 52.9% and 49.5% as measured by SOL, TST and SE respectively. For TST, 142 (47%) patients showed no misperception, 75 (24.8%) had under-perception, and 85 (28.2%) exhibited over-perception. For SE, frequencies were similar. Considering SOL, over-perception was found in 68%, and under-perception was found in 22%. Subjects with under-perception of TST, compared to those without, were signiicantly younger (44.4 +/- 12.5 vs. 52.2 +/- 12.9 years, p<0.001), had higher sleep eficiency (81.6 +/- 78.6, p=0.021), fewer arousals/hr (15.1 +/- 9.5 vs. 18.8 +/- 13.5, p=0.012) and a shorter latency to sleep (19.3+/-16.6 vs. 24.4+/-24.1, p=0.047). In a regression model, age was the only independent variable associated with under-perceiver (OR=0.956, CI=0.935-0.976). Conclusion(s): SSM is common in OSA.

Researchers have found that there is a discrepancy between actigraphy and self-report in older adults with co-morbid medical conditions and that this discrepancy is affected by individual characteristics. However, this relationship and discrepancy is unclear in healthy older adults. The purpose of this study was to determine the difference between actigraphy and diary estimates of sleep onset latency (SOL) and total sleep time (TST), and to determine how sleep quality, depressive symptoms, and memory are associated with the difference between actigraphy and sleep diary estimates of sleep. Method(s): Data were gathered from 78 participants (Mage= 74.06 years-old, SD= 6.65). A majority were female (69%) and White/Caucasian (96%). Participants completed sleep diaries (i.e., subjective sleep), questionnaires (Geriatric Depression Scale, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, immediate and delayed recall tasks), and wore actigraphs (i.e., objective sleep) for 4-7 nights (Mnights= 6.88, SD= 0.46). Differences between total sleep time (TST) and sleep onset latency (SOL) were calculated by subtracting sleep diary self-reports from actigraphy sleep estimates. Result(s): Multiple Wilcoxin Signed-Rank tests were conducted to examine the discrepancy between self-reported and actigraphy measured SOL and TST. Self-reported SOL was significantly greater than actigraphy measured SOL (z= 6.95, p <.001). Self-reported TST was greater than actigraphy measured TST (z= 2.51, p= .014). Multilevel regression models revealed that participants who reported worse sleep quality had a greater discrepancy between their sleep diary and actigraphy estimated SOL (gamma= 1.69, SE = 0.42, p < .01). Conclusion(s): Results demonstrated that healthy older adults perceived taking longer to fall asleep and sleeping more than what was indicated from actigraphy data. Worse sleep quality predicted a greater incongruence between self-reported and actigraphy estimated sleep onset latency. Future studies should continue to investigate how psychological and physiological functioning and processes impacts the discrepancy between self-reported and actigraphy estimated sleep in healthy older adults and explore the longitudinal pattern of this discrepancy.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,actigraph;aged;Caucasian;controlled study;depression;female;Geriatric Depression Scale;human;human experiment;major clinical study;memory;night;Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index;questionnaire;self report;sleep latency;*sleep quality;sleep time;conference abstract,,,,A comparison of the discrepancy between self-reported and objectively measured sleep at home and in the laboratory,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Few evidences addressed the frequency and associated factors of the entire sleep misperception spectrum. We aimed to evaluate the frequency and predictive factors of individuals with accurate sleep estimation, underestimators, and overestimators in a representative sample of Sao Paulo city, Brazil. Method(s): This was a cross-sectional investigation with the data provided by EPISONO cohort. A total sample of 971 participants of 20-80 years-old were included in the study. Sleep misperception classification as accurate, underestimators, and overestimators were performed according to the subjective sleep ratio values. Sleep, clinical, psychological, and biochemical parameters were compared among the groups. Result(s): A mean objective total sleep time of 342 +/- 2.4 min and subjective of 391.6 +/- 2.9 min were observed, with a sleep discrepancy of 4.8 min and a misperception index of -0.04 min. Underestimators and overestimators composed 28.8% and 35.6% of the sample, respectively. Early morning awakening insomnia was associated with a 2.67- fold increased risk of negative sleep misperception. C-reactive protein level predicted a 2-fold increased risk of overestimation of sleep time. Conclusion(s): Different spectra of sleep misperception show distinct associations with sleep and biochemical parameters. Our findings indicated that overestimation of sleep time may be related to a proinflammatory state, suggesting that patients with positive sleep misperception could be a high-risk population for medical conditions.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,adult;aged;arousal;Brazil;cohort analysis;controlled study;female;gene expression;high risk population;human;human tissue;insomnia;major clinical study;male;protein expression;*sleep time;C reactive protein;endogenous compound;conference abstract,,,,Evaluation of sleep misperception spectrum: Frequencies and associated factors in episono cohort,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Report of Case: Patient L, a 57-year-old married male presented to the sleep clinic with a chief concern regarding a reduction in his total sleep time (TST) to 4hours/night over the last one year. He also described a highly variable sleep onset latency and wake after sleep onset time with previous normal sleep duration. He reported several periods of up to 72 hours without any sleep. His wife stated she had observed him in bed, quietly sleeping, during these periods of self-described environmental awareness. There were no complaints of daytime somnolence and daytime impairment was limited to mild changes in his short term memory. Two weeks before his evaluation, he described a period of suicidal ideation followed by several days of expansive mood and hyperactivity, resulting in psychiatric hospitalization and a diagnosis of mania. Physical examination: BMI 22.9; Friedman palate position II; Neck circumference 15 inches. Polysomnography: No sleep disordered breathing. TST - 279min, Stage N1 - 8%, Stage N2 - 50%, Stage N3 - 0%, Stage R - 21%.The patient reported no subjective sleep. A diagnosis of paradoxical insomnia was given to the patient. Conclusion(s): Subjective lack of sleep is a common complaint and insomnia is a useful clinical indicator of the onset of new (or relapse of existing) mood disorders, particularly depression. Paradoxical insomnia is an uncommon condition characterized by a subjective complaint of severe insomnia without evidence of objective sleep disturbance and without daytime impairment commensurate with the degree of the reported sleep deicit.

Lebel, Laval University, Quebec, QC, Canada","Introduction: Hyperarousal is linked to sleep misperception, which is especially present in paradoxical insomnia (PARA-I). ERP studies showed that hyperarousal can be expressed through enhanced information processing, which is different between PARA-I and psychophysiological insomnia (PSY-I). Our objective is to use ERPs to investigate the link between misperception and information processing. Specifically, N1 (vigilance) and P2 (inhibition) were chosen for information processing and sleep onset latency (SOL) and wake after sleep onset (WASO) were used for misperception. Our hypothesis is that the link between misperception and information processing will be stronger for PARA-I than for PSY-I and good sleepers (GS). Method(s): 50 GS (age 34.7 +/- 9.0), 40 PSY-I (40.9 +/- 9.1) and 29 PARA-I (39.41 +/- 9.2) underwent four PSG nights. Subjective and objective sleep measures were obtained for SOL and WASO. ERPs were recorded all night on Night 4 (oddball paradigm). A linear mixed model including 3 within-subject factors (peak, N1 and P2; auditory stimuli, standard and deviant; recording time, S2E, S2L, SWS, REM), 3 between-subject independent factors (group, GS, PARA-I, PSY-I; SOL and WASO misperception, over, good, under) was computed on amplitude data at Cz. Misperception was calculated as the difference between subjective and objective measures. Result(s): Results revealed no differences between groups for information processing (p = 0.451). However, the interaction effect group x peak, (p=0.004), showed that P2 was higher in PARA-I. There was no moderator effect of group on the link between misperception and hyperarousal (p=0.769, p=0.440). Conclusion(s): A higher P2 in PARA-I would indicate that they need to deploy more energy to inhibit information processing, which would explain their greater misperception. Knowing that hyperarousal is a 24-hour problem, daytime ERPs should be investigated in connexion with sleep misperception. No group moderation effect means that the link between misperception and hyperarousal stays stable across sleep types. Consequently, mechanisms linking sleep misperception and hyperarousal appear similar for each group.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,adult;alertness;clinical article;controlled study;*evoked response;human;*information processing;*insomnia;night;statistical model;stimulus;Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders;Sleep,,,,Information processing during sleep and sleep misperception in insomnia: An ERP study,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lecci, University Hospital Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland","Introduction: Sleep misperception (SMP), the impression of being awake despite polysomnographically documented sleep, is sometimes observed in healthy individuals and to an extreme degree in patients with paradoxical insomnia. The mechanisms underlying the subjective perception of sleep are not well understood. Here we asked whether high-density (hd) EEG, a technique with a refined spatial resolution, could identify local wake-like brain activity related to SMP. Method(s): 14 healthy subjects (age 33.6 +/- 8.5 yrs, 10 females) underwent a serial awakening paradigm in the sleep lab while recorded with hdEEG (256 electrodes). 969 awakenings were performed across all sleep stages. At each awakening, subjects were asked to describe what was going through their mind and to estimate if immediately prior to the awakening they had been asleep or awake. Result(s): SMP occurred in 10 subjects (15.92 +/- 8.76% per subject, total of n=99 episodes of SMP). 70.83% of SMP episodes occurred in N1, 18.77% in N3, 9.79% in N2 and 3.57% in REM sleep. Only SMP in stages N2 and N3 was further considered. Compared to correct sleep perception (CSP), SMP occurred earlier in the night (147 +/- 79 min after lights off vs 231 +/- 25 min; p=0.0038). The presence of conscious experiences during sleep did not distinguish SMP from CSP, but experiences associated with SMP tended to be more thought-like and less perceptual compared to CSP (Score: 0.52 +/- 1.17 for SMP; -1.00 +/- 1.84 for CSP; p=0.076). SMP was associated with increased alpha (8-12 Hz) and sigma power (12-16 Hz) in central and posterior brain regions in the 20s before the awakening. No significant differences were observed for other frequency bands. Conclusion(s): The preferential occurrence of SMP early in the night, its quasi-absence in REM sleep and its association with increased alpha power in sensorimotor regions may indicate that the subjective perception of sleep depends on the degree of sleep-related environmental disconnection. Further analyses are needed to determine whether these findings also apply to patients with paradoxical insomnia.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,adult;arousal;brain region;controlled study;electrode;*electroencephalogram;female;human;insomnia;light;major clinical study;perception;*REM sleep;thinking;wakefulness;conference abstract;Electroencephalography,,,,The EEG correlates of sleep misperception,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nonetheless, sleep studies with PTSD patients have reported inconsistent findings. This may be caused by not controlling for comorbidity and heterogeneity of the subjects. Strict selection of subjects without any other psychiatric, medical disorder or medication usage and within the same traumatic event is very important. Taegu subway fire in Korea, on February 18, 2003 resulted in 192 loss and hundreds injured. We, in this study, attempted to assess differences between objective and subjective sleep variables in a very homogeneous, single event-related PTSD subjects and controls based on actigraphic monitoring and selfrating questionnaires. Method(s): We examined 14 survivors of Taegu subway fire (7 males, 7 females, 26.4+/-6.7 years of age) and 15 age-and sex-matched controls (6 males, 9 females, 28.7+/-6.6 years of age). Wrist-actigraph (Actiwatch, Mini Mitter Co., U.S.A.) was worn on their non-dominant hand for more than 3 days with 1 minute data acquisition interval. Simultaneously, sleep diary and PSQI (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index) were administered. The 3-day actigraphic data were averaged. We, using Actiware-Sleep (Mini Mitter Co., U.S.A.), analyzed total sleep time, sleep latency, sleep efficiency and other variables of actigraphic data to assess objective sleep and also obtained self-reported total sleep time, sleep latency, sleep efficiency and others from PSQI to assess subjective sleep. And then, we compared objective and subjective sleep variables between PTSD patients and controls by T-test. And then, we evaluated correlation objective sleep variables with subjective sleep quality by Pearson's correlation coefficient. Result(s): No significant differences of sleep variables measured with the actigraph were found between PTSD patients and normal controls (sleep percent: 91.1+/-3.09 vs. 90.5+/-3.42, p = 0.608; wake percent: 8.86+/-3.09 vs. 9.49+/-3.41, p = 0.755; actual sleep time: 338.5+/-46.2 vs. 344.3+/-52.5, p = 0.604; sleep efficiency: 82.4+/-6.63 vs. 82.8+/-5.68, p = 0.841; sleep latency: 24.3+/-23.0 vs. 20.5+/-23.2, p = 0.662; mean length of immobility: 9.1+/-2.7 vs. 9.3+/-1.9, p = 0.804; fragmentation index: 15.6+/-5.3 vs. 14.7+/-5.6, p = 0.637). However, subjective sleep scores obtained from PSQI showed poor sleep in PTSD patients vs. controls (global PSQI score: 10.9+/-3.1 vs. 5.1+/-2.6, p < 0.001; sleep efficiency: 84.2+/-9.5 vs. 95.7+/- 6.2, p < 0.05; sleep latency: 46.4+/-36.7 vs. 20.7+/-15.4, p < 0.05). Also, no correlation between objective and subjective sleep variables. Conclusion(s): PTSD patients strictly selected from a single event of subway fire compared with age-and sex-matched normal controls showed no significant differences in objective sleep quality but rather significant differences in subjective sleep quality. This finding supports previous studies which report and interpret poor sleep quality in PTSD patients as sleep state misperception.

We explored factors hypothesized to contribute to discrepancies between self-report and objective sleep measures (i.e., actigraphy; polysomnography) in Temporomandibular Joint Disorder (TMJD), a chronic pain condition with a high prevalence of sleep disturbances. Method(s): Baseline data was collected from 125 women diagnosed with TMJD and sleep disturbance (Insomnia Severity Index>8) as part of a larger study evaluating psychological interventions for sleep and pain. Assessment included self-report questionnaires, a one-night in-home polysomnography (PSG), 14 days of actigraphy and 14 days of daily diaries measuring standard sleep variables as well as mood and pain. Result(s): Correlations between self-report and actigraphy measures of sleep with PSG showed the following: Total Sleep Time (TST) (rs=.62- .70; p<.001); Time in Bed (TIB) (rs=.63-.79; p<.001); Wake after sleep onset (WASO) (rs = .12-.34; ps = .001-.23); Sleep Efficiency (rs = .23- .27; p<.05); and Sleep onset latency (rs=-.01, N.S). Discrepancy between PSG and self-perceptions (by diary) of TST, TIB and WASO were negatively correlated with percent of Slow Wave Sleep (%SWS) (rs = -.24-(-.54); p<.05). Multiple regression analyses demonstrated that higher %SWS was associated with an overestimation of TST, TIB and WASO by self-report relative to PSG even when controlling for same day pain, positive and negative affect, pre-sleep arousal, catastrophizing and demographic variables. Conclusion(s): In these women with TMJD with impaired sleep and pain cognitions, perceptions of TST, TIB and WASO were associated with the percent of SWS measured by PSG. Sleep duration and continuity have been shown to impact pain perceptions and endogenous pain modulatory mechanisms. Consequently, future research should focus on interventions designed to deepen and consolidate sleep as a means of not only improving sleep but pain outcomes as well.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,actimetry;arousal;catastrophizing;chronic pain;diagnosis;female;human;insomnia;Insomnia Severity Index;major clinical study;mood;multiple regression;night;nociception;polysomnography;prevalence;questionnaire;self report;*sleep quality;sleep time;*slow wave sleep;temporomandibular joint disorder;Sleep,,,,Amount of slow wave sleep is associated with the discrepancies between objective and subjective sleep measures,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, differences between self-reported and objectively measured sleep parameters (subjectiveobjective sleep discrepancy or sleep misperception) are very common. Insomnia and sleep apnea cause common impairments that overlap and have negative impacts on overall health. Previous studies have encouraged an in-depth understanding of subjective-objective sleep discrepancy to inform a role for behavioral, mind-body approaches to insomnia. In this study, utilizing patients with insomnia and comorbid sleep apnea, we aimed to understand associations between self-reported insomnia, sleep difficulties, sleep misperception and quality-of-life. Method(s): We conducted a secondary analysis using data from the Sleep Heart Health Study (a multi-site nationally representative sample) to examine the profile of subjective and objective sleep measures in people with insomnia (IS, n=73) and comorbid sleep apnea (IS+SA, n=143), compared to individuals with sleep apnea only (SA, n=296) and normal sleep controls (NSC, n=126). We also compared the magnitude of sleep misperception between these four groups and examined the corresponding impact of subjective insomnia complaints on quality-of-life. Result(s): Sleep discrepancy was found in all four groups. After controlling for age, sex, mental health conditions, sleep apnea severity, and objectively measured sleep time, the presence of self-reported insomnia had the strongest association with sleep discrepancy on total sleep time (TST, beta=-34.4, p<0.001) and sleep onset latency (SOL, beta=14.7, p<0.001). Subjects who reported no difficulty falling asleep slightly underestimated their sleep onset latency, while those who reported difficulty substantially overestimated sleep latency. Selfreported insomnia had a significantly negative impact on the quality of life in both physical and mental components (p<0.001). Conclusion(s): Sleep discrepancy exists in normal controls, insomnia, and sleep apnea. Subjects with self-reported insomnia have a higher degree of sleep misperception. Both sleep apnea and self-reported insomnia are associated with negative QOL. Those with comorbid sleep apnea report the greatest sleep discrepancy and lowest QOL. Further research is needed to better understand individual profiles of misperception and insomnia phenotypes, apnea comorbidity and qualityof- life. Behavioral, mind-body interventions may offer strategies to address mental stress, sleep misperception, and insomnia.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,"adult;comorbidity;conference abstract;controlled study;female;heart;human;*insomnia;major clinical study;male;mental health;mental stress;phenotype;*quality of life;secondary analysis;*sleep disordered breathing;sleep latency;*sleep time;Quality of Life;Sleep Apnea Syndromes;Sleep Apnea, Obstructive;Sleep;Apnea;Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders",,,,Subjective-objective sleep discrepancy and quality of life in self-reported insomnia and sleep apnea,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Paradoxical insomniacs show a ""consistent marked mismatch""between objective and subjective self-reported or diary estimations. The aim of the present study was to validate statistically a new index, correlated positively with the magnitude of sleep misperception and able to indicate its direction. An attempt was also made to establish an eventual threshold value for sleep misperception in the diagnosis of paradoxical insomnia (PI). Method(s): Two-step retrospective (study 1) and prospective (study 2) validation study was carried out. The study 1 included 288 normal subjects (176 females and 112 males, mean age 58.5 years, SD 7.23). Study 2 included 159 patients (98 females and 61 males; mean age 49.1 years, SD 12.71) with primary insomnia. Participants underwent a full-night polysomnographic study, followed by a morning assessment of subjective sleep parameters. A Misperception Index (MI) was computed using the following formula: MI=[objective total sleep time (oTST)-subjective total sleep time (sTST)]/oTST. Result(s): The Bland-Altman test in controls demonstrated the reliability of this index for values of oTST > 120 min. The statistical analysis of the distribution of MI in insomnia patients disclosed the presence of two subgroups, one with a moderate sleep misperception (132 patients) and another with high sleep misperception (27 patients). The latter presented MI values >0.9, exhibiting statistical properties different from those with MI <0.9 and from normal subjects. Conclusion(s): This study demonstrates that the application of a standardized and statistically validated approach to the study of sleep mispercep- tion in primary insomnia is able to disclose a subgroup o patients with a probable true sleep misperception insomnia which might be as rare as reported in the current classification system.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,*sleep;*health care organization;patient;insomnia;sleep time;male;female;diagnosis;time perception;night;sleep parameters;reliability;statistical analysis;classification;validation study,,,,Validation of a misperception index to measure the error in sleep estimation and identify paradoxical insomniacs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

McGovney, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO, United States","Introduction: Discrepancies between self-reported and actigraphy assessed sleep are common in patients with fibromyalgia (FM). This may partially be due to methods of actigraphy analysis, which often use non-standardized accelerometry algorithms that do not accurately estimate rest intervals (i.e., bedtime/waketime interval), and lead to inaccurate computation of sleep variables. Here, we describe the MizZzou Sleep Lab Actigraphy Protocol (MSLAP) as an alternative to automated rest interval detection (AUTO). Application of MSLAP relative to AUTO was carried out in a sample of patients with FM. For each method, magnitude of discrepancies between actigraphy/self-reported sleep were compared. Method(s): Fourty-seven adults with FM completed three days of actigraphy and sleep diaries measuring bedtime, waketime, SOL, sleep efficiency (SE), wake after sleep onset (WASO), and total sleep time (TST). For actigraphy analysis, rest intervals were determined using MSLAP and AUTO (in Philips Actiware V.6.0.8). MSLAP determines probable bedtimes/waketimes using a hierarchical procedure: 1) visually inspect activity/light signal, 2) identify trigger value where activity/light reaches zero (bedtime), or activity/light exceeds 100 or 1uW/cm2 (waketime), 3) detect ten consecutive subsequent epochs meeting sub/supra-threshold criteria for activity/ light. For MSLAP and AUTO, bedtime and waketime were recorded, and SOL, SE, WASO, and TST were computed using validated Actiware sleep scoring algorithms. Paired t-tests determined whether magnitude of subjective/objective sleep outcome discrepancies differed between MSLAP and AUTO. Result(s): Bedtime objective/subjective discrepancies were lower (p<.001) for MSLAP (M=32.7mins, SD=36.0) relative to AUTO (M=55.4mins, SD=79.3). Waketime discrepancies were also lower (p<.001) for MSLAP (M=23.3mins, SD=40.5) relative to AUTO (M=40.5mins, SD=71.5). SOL discrepancies were lower (p=.04) for MSLAP (M=43.0mins, SD=35.1) relative to AUTO (M=47.4mins, SD=36.7). Subjective/objective discrepancies between MSLAP and AUTO did not differ for SE, WASO, or TST. Conclusion(s): Compared to automated accelerometry rest interval detection algorithms, MSLAP may reduce discrepancies between self-reported and actigraphically assessed sleep in FM. Results promote the use of MSLAP in actigraphy analysis, which may help clinicians assess and treat sleep disorders in patients with chronic pain.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,accelerometry;*actimetry;adult;chronic pain;clinical article;clinician;controlled study;female;*fibromyalgia;human;human tissue;male;rest;sleep disorder;sleep latency;*sleep quality;sleep time;endogenous compound;conference abstract;Fibromyalgia,,,,Actigraphy assessment in fibromyalgia: A standardized protocol to reduce discrepancies between subjective and objective sleep,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we compared subjective, objective and retrospective sleep quality ratings among patients with major depressive disorders (MDD), social anxiety (SAD) and healthy controls (HC). We hypothesized that, compared to controls, patients will show (1) stronger misperception of sleep (difference between objective sleep continuity measures and subjective sleep evaluation immediately after sleep) and (2) a larger memory experience gap (MeG, i.e. disagreement between the insomnia rating of the previous week, compared to the promptly subjective and objective assessments). Method(s): Age and gender matched groups of 56 patients with MDD 14 patients with SAD and 58 HC took part in the present study. Sleep was assessed by actimetry over seven consecutive nights. Subjective sleep was assessed (1) each morning immediately after awakening with the question ""How do you rate your sleep quality"" on a metric scale from 0 (best sleep quality) to 100 (worst sleep quality), and (2) retrospectively, after the week of actimetry, with the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI; with higher scores indicating worse sleep quality) referring to overall sleep quality of the past seven nights. Result(s): Neither retrospective sleep assessment nor immediate sleep morning assessment correlated with objective sleep measurements in any of the three groups (p's > 0.15), except for a positive correlation with SOL in SAD subjects (r = 0.59, p < 0.05). By trend of significance (p < 0.10), retrospective ISI ratings of MDD subjects were worse and ISI ratings of SAD patients better than immediate sleep morning ratings, while there was no MeG in healthy controls. Conclusion(s): The results of our study confirm previous observations of misperception of sleep, even when sleep evaluation was performed immediately in the morning. In addition, in patients with depression or anxiety, retrospective sleep assessments by questionnaires may be confounded by a MeG.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,"actimetry;adult;*anxiety;arousal;controlled study;female;gender;human;insomnia;Insomnia Severity Index;major clinical study;*major depression;male;*memory;night;questionnaire;retrospective study;*sleep pattern;sleep quality;conference abstract;Depressive Disorder, Major;Depressive Disorder;Anxiety",,,,"Misperception of sleep patterns and memory experience gap among patients with major depressive disorders, and social anxiety, and healthy controls",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for insomnia, by addressing distorted beliefs and perceptions about sleep and insomnia symptoms, may indirectly reduce the discrepancy between subjective and PSG measures of total sleep time. This secondary analysis of data from an insomnia treatment trial aimed at investigating the impact of CBT for insomnia on sleep misperception. Method(s): A total of 160 individuals with chronic insomnia (mean age = 50.3 years, 60.6% women) were randomized to CBT alone or CBT combined with hypnotic medication. CBT consisted of six weekly group sessions including standard behavioral (stimulus control, sleep restriction) and cognitive procedures. Preand post-treatment assessments included sleep diaries, questionnaires, and PSG recordings (three baseline and two post-treatment nights). Participants completed morning questionnaires estimating several sleep-wake variables after each PSG recording. Percentage of accurate estimation of TST was computed from PSG data as : (estimated TST objective TST)/objective TST X 100 (a negative score means an underestimation of TST). Values from the second and third baseline nights and the two post-treatment nights were averaged for each participant and analyzed using repeated-measures ANOVA. Result(s): Overall, TST was underestimated by 17.5% (SD = 21.9, median = -13.7%) at baseline and underestimated by 7% (SD = 15.4, median = -6%) at post-treatment, which translates into an average underestimation of 67 and 23 minutes, respectively, compared to PSG recordings. There was a signifcant time effect suggesting an overall reduction of the magnitude of sleep underestimation. A signifcant group X time interaction effect indicated that the combined group had a larger reduction in sleep misperception than the CBT alone group. Exploratory analysis suggested that the improvement of sleep perception was positively associated with improvement reported on sleep diary measures, but not on the other questionnaires. Conclusion(s): Results suggest that CBT for insomnia helps reduce sleep misperception in individuals with chronic insomnia, despite the fact that this issue was not directly addressed in the course of treatment. Larger reduction of sleep misperception in the combined group may refect a drug-induced improvement of sleep perception.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,*sleep;*insomnia;*health care organization;recording;night;questionnaire;sleep time;cognitive therapy;secondary analysis;drug therapy;stimulus;female;analysis of variance;sleep disorder;hypnotic agent;Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders;Sleep,,,,Does CBT for insomnia alter sleep misperceptions?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sleep misperception (SM), a key feature of insomniacs with particular dimension in paradoxical insomnia, remains quite unexplained. Method(s): The retrospective cohort study (n = 332) included: 276 patients (65.9% of women; mean of 47.3 +/- 14.8 years age) with the clinical diagnosis of insomnia and 56 patients (75.4% of women; mean of 40.9 +/- 13.2 years age) with paradoxical insomnia. All patients performed a polysomnographic (PSG) study type I. The analyzed variables were the PSG data. To evaluate SM three formulas were used based on objective and subjective total sleep time (DELTAdelta=objectiveTST-subjectiveTST; index=objectiveTST-subjectiveTST/ objectiveTST and coefficient=objectiveTST/subjectiveTST). Student t-test or Mann-Whitney, was used according to data distribution; significance was settled at p <= 0.05. Variables presenting statistical differences in both groups, logistic regression models were tested in order to determine if some of these parameters could be associated to the different misperception indexes used. Result(s): Most of the PSG parameters were different between groups (p < 0.05) (exception of N3, N2 percentages and mean heart rate). The subjectiveTST was 228.56 +/- 105.61 min for insomnia and 326.86 +/- 118.36 min for paradoxical insomnia (p = 0.003). Concerning the three formulas analyzed for SM no differences were found between groups. For all variables presenting statistically significant difference a regression model was performed. In the Insomnia group DELTAdelta was explained by the TST (p < 0.001) and by sleep efficiency (p < 0.05); there was no association with the index; the coefficient was explained by sleep efficiency (p < 0.003). In paradoxical insomnia group there was no association between any misperception measures and PSG parameters. Conclusion(s): Sleep misperception does not influence the diagnosis of insomnia and paradoxical insomnia. In spite of similar measures of misperception in both groups, paradoxical insomnia demonstrated higher subjective sleep time. For insomniacs associations between misperception and PSG were found; this was not the case for paradoxical insomnia, what implies the need of future research. From our data paradoxical insomnia is a clear-cut entity.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,adult;cohort analysis;controlled study;diagnosis;female;heart rate;human;*insomnia;major clinical study;retrospective study;sleep quality;sleep time;conference abstract;Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders,,,,Searching for paradoxical insomnia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aims at characterizing SSM in chronic primary insomnia (INS) vs good sleepers (GS) using assessments both in-lab with polysomnography (PSG) and at-home using actigraphy and sleep diaries. Method(s): 43 INS (49.5 +/- 14.2 years; 34 females) and 25 GS (42.72 +/- 15.6 years; 16 females) had a screening PSG, followed by actigraphy combined with sleep diaries for 11.5 (+/- 2.2) days at home, then came back at the lab for a second PSG with subjective sleep assessment. SSM scores (subjective minus objective data) were calculated for TST, SOL, WASO using PSG along with self-reported sleep for in-lab SSM, and actigraphy combined with sleep diaries for at-home SSM. Group effect on SSM scores were tested using ANOVAs, with age and sex as covariates. Pairwise t-tests assessed differences between subjective and objective measures within each group. Result(s): SSM for TST was different between groups, both in-lab (F(1,64) = 16.3, p < 0.001) and at-home (F(1,64) = 27.03, p < 0.001), with an underestimation of TST in INS both in-lab and at-home (all p < 0.001) and an overestimation for GS only at home (p < 0.001). There was no in-lab SSM difference between groups for WASO (F(1,41) = 0.1, p = 0.7), nor difference between PSG and subjective WASO in either group (p > 0.05). There was a group effect for at-home WASO SSM (F(1,64) = 12.12, p = 0.001), with GS underestimating (p < 0.001) and INS overestimating it (p = 0.02). Both assessments revealed a group effect on SSM for SOL (in-lab: F(1,64) = 5.08, p = 0.028; at-home: F(1,64) = 8.5, p = 0.005), with GS underestimating SOL at-home (p = 0.007) , while INS overestimated in-lab SOL (p = 0.0013). Finally, INS (but not GS) exhibited difference between in-lab subjective SOL and latencies to N1 and N2 sleep (all p < 0.01) but not latency to N3 (p = 0.12). Conclusion(s): GS and INS exhibit different patterns of sleep misperception. TST is the only variable for which SSM was similarly detected both in-lab and at-home. Individuals with chronic insomnia may have difficulties perceiving lighter stages of sleep (N1, N2), which might contribute to their overestimation of sleep onset.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,actimetry;adult;clinical article;conference abstract;controlled study;female;human;male;polysomnography;*primary insomnia;*sleep latency;stage 2 sleep;Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders,,,,Multimodal assessment of sleep misperception in chronic primary insomnia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These symptoms may also be present in other primary sleep disorders. Moreover, insomnia may coexist with these disorders, and sleep apnea is found in at least 30% of insomnia patients. The resulting clinical picture may be complex and difficult to tackle diagnostically and therapeutically. Paradoxical insomnia refers to a complaint of severe insomnia that is not on a par with objective evidence of sleep disturbance. Typically patients claim to have been awake for most of the night, whilst polysomnography shows little or no abnormalities in the hypnogram. Sleep apnea and paradoxical insomnia incidentally coexist. The particularities of this association will be discussed in the presentation.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,*sleep disordered breathing;*insomnia;*sleep;*society;human;patient;sleep disorder;polysomnography;night;diseases;diagnosis;Sleep Disorders;Sleep Apnea Syndromes;Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders;Respiration;Sleep,,,,Sleep disordered breathing and paradoxical insomnia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, about 15% of the patients who complain of insomnia may have sleep state misperception, with normal objective sleep. Endothelial function is a predictor of ischemic heart disease. We hypothesized that objective insomnia but not sleep state misperception will lead to overnight deterioration of endothelial function. Method(s): 29 patients complaining of insomnia (17 with objective insomnia and 12 with sleep state misperception) were studied. All underwent evening and morning assessment of blood pressure and endothelial function (reactive hyperemia test, EndoPAT, Itamar-Medical), full night in lab PSG, and morning urinary catecholamine levels. Result(s): The insomnia group had a total sleep time of 292+/-64min compared to 328+/-66min of the misperception group. The subjective estimated sleep time was 275+/-85min for the insomniacs, compared to 162+/-106min of the misperception group (p<0.005). While in the insomnia group the endothelial function deteriorated during the night (-0.24+/-0.48), in the misperception group it improved during the night (0.25+/-0.49, p<0.05). Urinary Dopamine /Creatinine levels for the insomnia and misperception groups were 199.8+/-55.4 vs 164.08+/-33.26 respectively, p<0.05. Conclusion(s): This study shows that in patients with objective insomnia endothelial function deteriorates during the night and their morning urinary dopamine levels are increased compared to patients with insomnia complaints but substantially better objective sleep, in whom endothelial function improved over the course of the night. These results suggest that patients with objective insomnia are at greater risk for cardiovascular complications compared to those with sleep state misperception.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,"*sleep;*organization;*deterioration;*insomnia;human;patient;night;sleep time;hyperemia;blood pressure;morbidity;catecholamine urine level;ischemic heart disease;risk;cardiovascular disease;dopamine;creatinine;Sleep Disorders, Intrinsic;Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders",,,,Objective insomnia but not sleep state misperception is associated with overnight deterioration of endothelial function,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Until recently, there have been few reports of this type of sleep misperception and no reports have focused on this condition in the elderly. Method(s): Clinical description of 3 elderly patients studied with standard polysomnography, including recordings of nasal pressure and end tidal C02, scored according to AASM 2007 criteria. Result(s): The 3 patients (2 male, 1 female) had an average age over 80 years. All had daytime impairment (excessive napping, fatigue, and daytime sleepiness) but reported sleeping well at home. Laboratory evaluation revealed markedly reduced sleep efficiency (22%, 55%, and 56%), and average sleep onset latency greater than 100 minutes. Despite polysomnographic evidence of strikingly impaired nighttime sleep with prolonged periods of wakefulness, all patients reported falling asleep within 30 minutes and having their typical quality sleep. 2 of 3 patients had severe periodic limb movements of sleep, primarily without arous- als (indexes of 111, 176), and 1 patient had mild obstructive and central sleep apnea syndrome. All patients were aware of daytime symptoms. Conclusion(s): Elderly patients with daytime symptoms of fatigue, sleepiness, and excessive napping, may suffer from severely impaired nighttime sleep wihout being aware of it. This may represent a discrete from of agnosia for a particular body state, in this case wakefulness at night, which may be distinct from awareness of other states such as sleepiness during the day. In contrast to paradoxical insomnia, patients with reverse sleep state misperception fail to report a problem and therefore are more likely to receive inadequate diagnostic evaluation.

Individuals who overestimate sleep disturbances may be at increased risk for insomnia. A few studies have shown demographic differences in the accuracy of sleep estimation when comparing subjective and objective measures; however, the previous literature is inconsistent and focuses primarily on older adults. We sought to replicate these studies in a large sample of nurses using 14 days of sleep diary and actigraphy measures. Method(s): Participants were 392 nurses (91.8% female; 77.8% white, mean age = 39.54) recruited for a larger study. Participants completed 14 days of actigraphy and sleep diaries to prospectively assess total sleep time (TST) and sleep efficiency (SE). Discrepancy between diary and actigraphy measures was calculated by subtracting actigraphy measures from diary measures. Linear regression was used to examine how age, race (0 = race other than white, 1 = white), gender (1 = male, 2 = female), ethnicity (1= non-Hispanic/Latinx, 2 = Hispanic/Latinx) predicted degree of sleep discrepancy. Result(s): The average discrepancy between diary and actigraphy TST was 30.29 minutes (SD = 29.28), and the average discrepancy between diary and actigraphy SE was 4.16% (SD = 5.66). Race and ethnicity did not predict amount of TST or SE discrepancy. However, younger individuals had more discrepancy in both TST (b = -0.48, p < .001) and SE (b = -0.09, p < .001). Men also had a greater discrepancy in both TST (b = -10.90, p < .05) and SE (b = -2.56, p < .05). Conclusion(s): Men and younger individuals had greater discrepancies between diary and actigraphy measures of sleep. This is in contrast to some previous research showing that elderly women tend to display greater discrepancies between subjective and objective measures of sleep. It is essential that future research explore the discrepancies between subjective and objective measures of sleep in larger and more demographically diverse samples. Establishing a better understanding of this relationship is crucial, as it may have significant implications for the diagnosis and treatment of insomnia.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,*actimetry;adult;aged;conference abstract;controlled study;*demography;ethnicity;female;gender;Hispanic;human;insomnia;linear regression analysis;male;nurse;race;sleep efficiency;*sleep time;ABC transporter G1;endogenous compound;Sleep,,,,Demographic differences in the degree of discrepancy between sleep diary and actigraphy measures of sleep,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Symptoms of PI include a lack of awareness of achievement of a sleep state with reports of unsustainable sleep deprivation. This subjective report contrasts with objective reports or observation by family/friends of adequate sleep. Currently, no standard treatment for PI exists, but methods include anti-psychotic medication and sleep education. Case Report A 16-year-old African American male with a history of intermittent asthma presented to sleep clinic with a complaint of obtaining less than 2 hours of sleep at night, and occasions of going 2-3 days at a time with no sleep. He stated he can stay up for over a week without any sleep. He was alert and appropriately engaged during the evaluation. He denied daytime sleepiness or poor concentration, and participated in online high school. The patient had a normal physical examination without craniofacial abnormalities, normal nasal passage, Mallampati 2 oral cavity, normal BMI, and normal neurologic examination. Polysomnography was deemed not indicated based on history and physical examination. The patient denied symptoms of depression or anxiety. Diagnostic evaluation included one week of actigraphy monitoring to estimate typical sleep/wake patterns. Actigraphy data was significant for slightly insufficient sleep for age (average 7.75 h per night), sleep efficiency within normal limits (average 86%), rapid sleep onset (<10 minutes on average), and a biphasic sleep pattern on 3 occasions with extended night wakings characterized by high levels of activity. A concurrent sleep diary completed by patient indicated he perceived that he obtained only 4 hours of sleep on 3 occasions throughout the duration of the study. He reported doing other activities during the night, such as using the computer, bicycling outside, or going to fast food restaurants. The actigraphy was reviewed in detail with the patient and family, and sleep education provided. Because of lack of evidence for other sleep disorders (e.g., sleep-disordered breathing) and the patients unconcern for the perceived lack of sleep, no additional intervention was initiated. The patient's lifestyle of online schooling and flexible study hours allowed him to be successful with his academic work. Discussion PI is not well described in adolescence and not typically included in reviews of pediatric insomnia. Further case descriptions and additional research on PI in adolescent insomnia is recommended to understand pediatric prevalence and identify effective treatment strategies.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,actimetry;adolescence;adolescent;African American;anxiety;asthma;body mass;case report;catering service;child;clinical article;craniofacial malformation;cycling;daytime somnolence;depression;fast food;high school;human;*insomnia;lifestyle;male;monitoring;mouth cavity;neurologic examination;*night sleep;physical examination;polysomnography;prevalence;sleep deprivation;sleep disordered breathing;sleep pattern;sleep quality;wakefulness;neuroleptic agent;conference abstract;Adolescent;Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders,,,,Not-so-sleepless-nights: An adolescent with paradoxical insomnia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sweetman, School of Psychology, Flinders University, Adelaide, SA, Australia","Objectives: Co-morbid insomnia occurs in 40-60% of Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) patients. To develop effective treatments for this co-morbid condition, it is important to investigate factors causing this high co-occurrence. Insomnia is commonly associated with underestimations of total sleep time, and overestimations of time spent awake, resulting from patients misperceiving prior sleep as wakefulness. OSA is characterised by sleep fragmentation, increased light sleep, and oxygen desaturations throughout the night. It is possible that the sleep fragmentation resulting from OSA predisposes patients to awaken during the night and misperceive their sleep as wakefulness. This may lead to the development of a subjective insomnia complaint. Method(s): Participants included 116 individuals with OSA (AHI>15) and insomnia (ICSD-2) who completed an overnight polysomnographic sleep study, and sleep diary. Objective sleep time was subtracted from diary sleep time to create 'misperception' scores. Relationships between these misperception scores, and several indices of OSA-severity were examined with correlational analyses. Result(s): Misperceptions of total sleep time were significantly positively correlated with AHI (r(114) = 0.21, P = 0.03), arousal index (r(115) = 0.22, P = 0.02), percent stage 1 sleep (r (115) = 0.22, P = 0.02), and percent of time with oxygen saturation less than 90% (r(115) = 0.19, P = 0.04). Conclusion(s): These results indicate that greater underestimations of sleep are associated with night-time manifestations of OSA severity, including increased AHI, light sleep, and time with low oxygen saturation. The sleep fragmentation caused by OSA may predispose patients to underestimate their sleep, and develop an insomnia complaint. This may be one, of several pathways contributing to the co-occurrence of insomnia and OSA.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,"*apnea monitoring;arousal;human;ICSD-2;*insomnia;major clinical study;oxygen desaturation;oxygen saturation;*sleep disordered breathing;*sleep time;wakefulness;Comorbidity;Sleep Apnea Syndromes;Sleep Apnea, Obstructive;Apnea;Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders",,,,Role of sleep misperceptions in relationship between comorbid insomnia and obstructive sleep apnea,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Method(s): A prospective longitudinal study involved a consecutive series of patients (n=106) who underwent an overnight polysomnography with MSLT, and who had completed a set of morning questionnaires including questions querying the subjective perception of their sleep the night prior and the set of questions asking the patients to estimate their daytime MSLT naps. The sample was divided into two subgroups, those who correctly estimated their overnight sleep (CE), and those who either under- or over-estimated their overnight sleep (SSM, at least +/- 1.5 hour difference). The second subgroup was then divided into those with negative (NSSM) and those with positive sleep misperception (PSSM). The paired samples t-test was performed to analyze data. Result(s): The CE group (n=27) correctly estimated their daytime naps, and their difference between objective (9.9+/-5 minutes) and subjective nap duration (8.6+/-5.7 minutes) was not statistically significant. On the other hand, as a whole, those with sleep misperception (n=16) underestimated their naps (MSLTobject = 11.5+/-5.2 minutes, MSLTsubject = 6.6+/-5.1 minutes, p<0.001). When divided into subgroups, those who underestimated their overnight sleep (NSSM, n=6) also underestimated their daytime naps (MSLTobject = 12.4+/-4.7, MSLTsubject = 9.5+/- 5.6, p<0.05). However, in spite of their overestimation of night sleep, the PSSM group (n=10) grossly underestimated their daytime sleep (MSLTobject = 10.9+/-5.7 minutes, MSLTsubject = 4.9+/-4.7 minutes, p<0.05). Conclusion(s): The finding that CE patients are also able to correctly estimate their daytime naps is clinically useful in that, even in absence of MSLT testing, their subjective daytime nap estimate could be used at face value. On the other hand, as previous studies had shown, patients with PSSM present a clinical challenge because of their overestimation of night sleep and the resulting objective daytime sleepiness. The current study shows that these patients, in contrast to their overnight sleep, grossly underestimate their daytime sleep, and thus potentially reduce the chance of being seen by a clinician. The study also showed that patients who underestimate their overnight sleep have tendency to underestimate daytime naps as well.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,*sleep;*health care organization;patient;night sleep;night;Student t test;longitudinal study;polysomnography;questionnaire;daytime somnolence;Sleep,,,,Misperception of overnight sleep and daytime naps,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although event- related potentials (ERPs) provide powerful indexes of arousal levels in sleep, studies using them are scarce. The objective of the present study is to use ERPs (N1 and P2) to document arousal levels in Psy-I, Para-I and good sleepers (GS) in stages 2, 3-4 and REM sleep. Method(s): Eight Psy-I (mean age = 40.4y), 9 Para-I (mean age = 43.1y) and 10 GS (mean age = 43.9y) underwent four consecutive nights of PSG (N1 to N4). ERPs N1 and P2 were recorded during the fourth night in stages 2, 3-4 and REM. Auditory stimuli consisted of 'standard' frequent (70 dB, 2000 Hz, .85 probability) and 'deviant' rare stimuli (90 dB, 1500 Hz, .15 probability). Result(s): Mixed ANOVAs on N1 amplitude showed significant main effects of auditory stimuli F(1, 24) = 12.99, p < .01. Mixed ANOVAS on P2 amplitude resulted in significant effects for auditory stimuli (F(1, 23) = 30.23, p = .00). Furthermore, Recording Time x Auditory Stimuli (F(2, 46) = 4.13, p = .04) was also significant. Analyses on latency measures of N1 and P2 revealed no significant effects at all. No between groups differences were found. Conclusion(s): These preliminary results suggest that the amplitude and latency of the different ERPs is similar during stages 2, 3-4 and REM sleep in insomnia sufferers and good sleepers. Hyperarousal, as measured with ERPs, might thus be limited to the awake and sleep-onset periods and not sleep in insomnia sufferers.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,*sleep;*insomnia;*health care organization;auditory stimulation;arousal;night;latent period;REM sleep;stimulus;recording;event related potential;Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders;Sleep,,,,ERP measures during sleep in psychophysiological and paradoxical insomnia sufferers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Wassing, Sleep and Cognition, Amsterdam, Netherlands","Objectives: Insomnia seems a heterogeneous disorder with only few robust findings. There are three findings that are quite consistent across studies. First, people with insomnia overestimate the time that they spend awake during the night, a phenomenon called sleep state misperception and suggestive of ongoing mental content. Second, their sleep, especially REM sleep is frequently interrupted by arousals. Third, they experience round-the-clock hyperarousal. The present study investigated how these three characteristics may be linked. Method(s): In 32 people, the reported frequency of dreams and thought-like nocturnal mentation was associated with polysomnographically assessed sleep parameters. In 1199 people, thought-like nocturnal mentation was associated with questionnaire scores on insomnia severity, hyperarousal and the speed of dissolving emotional distress. In 40 people, dreams and thought-like nocturnal mentation were measured using diaries across days of repeated assessment of distress by exposure to a negative self-conscious emotional experience of shame or embarrassment. Result(s): Interestingly, restless REM sleep (arousal density and eye movement density) was associated with frequently experiencing thought-like nocturnal mentation rather than dreams. Nocturnal mentation increased with the severity of insomnia, interfered with the overnight dissolving of subjective distress after a negative selfconscious emotional experience, and contributed to the severity of hyperarousal. Conclusion(s): The findings suggest a mechanistic link between the three most consistent characteristics of insomnia.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,"arousal;dissolution;*dream;emotional stress;exposure;human;*insomnia;questionnaire;REM sleep;shame;sleep parameters;thinking;velocity;Sleep Deprivation;Sleep Disorders, Intrinsic;Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders",,,,"Linking three characteristics of insomnia: Sleep state misperception, fragmented sleep and hyperarousal",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Weathers, Fordham University, Bronx, NY, United States","Introduction: Sleep misperception is a phenomenon often identified in insomnia literature, in which individuals subjective reporting does not match objective measurements of their own sleep. Research indicates that anxiety symptoms may play a role in sleep misperception. This study assessed the relationship between sleep misperception, sleep quality, and anxiety in a young adult population with sub-clinical insomnia and anxiety symptoms. Linear regression models examined the relationships between sleep quality, anxiety symptoms, and sleep misperception. Method(s): This sample consisted of 130 young adults recruited from a University in the Bronx, NY. Anxiety was assessed using the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), and sleep quality was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Objective measures of sleep were collected via wrist-based actigraphy over a period of 7-14 days. Subjective sleep measures were collected via an online sleep diary. A misperception index was calculated to determine the discrepancy between subjective and objective sleep measures based on a formula established in previous research. Result(s): Higher anxiety symptoms were associated with greater sleep disturbance. Higher sleep misperception was not associated with greater sleep disturbance. There was a significant, positive relationship between sleep misperception and anxiety symptoms (r=0.18, p=0.000). Gender emerged as an important covariate, with males exhibiting significantly higher sleep misperception and underestimating TST (M=-0.31, SD=0.22) compared to females (M=-0.18, SD=0.12). Conclusion(s): Sleep misperception was not related to sleep quality, but was strongly related to anxiety symptoms in this population. In a sub-clinical young adult sample, sleep misperception is associated with anxiety but not sleep quality, and has significant gender differences. These findings contribute to sleep misperception literature with potential applications in diagnosis and treatment of insomnia and anxiety.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,actimetry;adult;*anxiety;Beck Anxiety Inventory;conference abstract;controlled study;female;human;human tissue;insomnia;linear regression analysis;major clinical study;male;Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index;sex difference;*sleep quality;wrist;young adult;Anxiety;Sleep,,,,"Sleep misperception, anxiety, and sleep quality",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Clinical studies use self-reported and objective measures to assess insomnia in LCS. However, negative beliefs of sleep patterns may impair sleep perception, impact psychological state, and influence insomnia treatment and survivorship outcomes. This study aims to assess the level of agreement between subjective and objective sleep measures in LCS. Method(s): Forty-four non-small cell lung cancer survivors, stage I-III, at least 6 weeks after treatment completion, with Insomnia Severity Index >7, were recruited from two sites from 2014-2016. Individuals with sleep apnea, menopause, rotating shift work, uncontrolled substance abuse, or unstable medical/psychiatric illnesses were excluded from the study. Agreement between total sleep time (TST), sleep latency (SL) and sleep efficiency (SE) from Sleep Diary and wrist-actigraphy (i.e. CamNtech) were assessed with Intraclass Correlation (ICC) and Bland-Altman plots. Analysis of ICC, mean difference, standard deviation (SD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were conducted using SPSS 24. Result(s): LCS were male (63.6%), 60-69 years old (52.3%), married or living with a partner (50%). Self-reported measurements underestimated TST (-68.2 minutes, ICC 0.45, CI 95%, SD 108.1) and SL (-25.9 minutes, ICC 95%, ICC -0.54, DS 17.5). Objective and self-reported measurements largely overlapped for SE, with a small actigraphy-based overestimation (9.2, ICC 0.2, CI95%, SD 7.3). Bland-Altman plots revealed that the agreement increased with lower SE values. Conclusion(s): LCS tended to underestimate TST and SL. An apparent agreement between objective and self-reported measures for SE may indicate sleep state misperception. Differences in various sleep parameters and potential covariates should be investigated for contribution to the unexplained considerable individual variability in behavioral treatment response among cancer survivors in larger sample sizes.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,actimetry;adult;aged;cancer staging;*cancer survival;*cancer survivor;clinical article;conference abstract;controlled study;data analysis software;female;human;human tissue;*insomnia;Insomnia Severity Index;male;married person;menopause;*non small cell lung cancer;rotating shift;sample size;sleep disordered breathing;sleep efficiency;sleep latency;*sleep time;substance abuse;treatment response;wrist;Lung Neoplasms;Lung;Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders;Survivors,,,,Level of agreement between objective and subjective sleep measures in lung cancer survivors with insomnia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In current study, we classified insomnia patients into negative sleep state misperception (NSSM) group and positive sleep state misperception (PSSM) group according to difference between subjective and objective sleep duration. We compared clinical and polysomnographic characteristics between two groups. Method(s): Objective sleep measures using nocturnal polysomnography (nPSG) and subjective measures including Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and subjective questionnaire at the morning after overnight nPSG of 150 insomnia patients were reviewed. The questionnaire included subjective total sleep time (subjective TST), subjective sleep latency (subjective SL). Additionally, TST/SL discrepancy was calculated by subtracting objective variables of nPSG from the morning subjective questionnaire. We calculated misperception index (MI) using the following method; MI=(objective TST-subjective TST)/objective TST. According to MI value, insomnia patients were classified into NSSM (MI>0, n=115), and PSSM (MI<0, n=35) groups. Result(s): There were no significant differences in nPSG parameters, except N3 sleep (%); the PSSM group had significantly higher N3 sleep than NSSM group (p=0.002). On the subjective measures, the NSSM group had significantly higher PSQI score (p<0.001), longer subjective SL (p=0.001) and higher SL discrepancy (p=0.001). In the NSSM group, MI showed positive correlations with N1 sleep proportion (r=0.250, p=0.011), PSQI (r=0.250, p=0.011), BDI (r=0.211, p=0.032), subjective SL (r=0.441, p<0.001) and SL discrepancy (r=0.453, p<0.001). Meanwhile, there were no significant correlations of MI with subjective measures in PSSM group. In the multiple regression analysis, MI was related with SL discrepancy and BDI (R2=0.216, p=0.004) in NSSM group. For belonging the PSSM group, associated factors were N3 sleep (OR=1.075, p=0.001), PSQI (OR=0.813, p=0.002) and SL discrepancy (OR=0.956, p<0.001) on binary logistic regression analysis. Conclusion(s): In the NSSM group, MI was related with high SL discrepancy and depressive mood. High N3 sleep, low PSQI score, and low SL discrepancy were associated factors in the PSSM group. Perception of sleep should be properly evaluated and managed, since they vary with different characteristics of sleep state misperception.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,"adult;Beck Depression Inventory;conference abstract;controlled study;depression;female;human;*insomnia;major clinical study;male;multiple regression;perception;Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index;polysomnography;questionnaire;sleep latency;sleep time;*slow wave sleep;Sleep Disorders, Intrinsic;Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders",,,,Comparisons of clinical and polysomnographic characteristics between negative and positive sleep state misperception in insomnia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Zaleta, Ohio State University, United States","BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Discrepancies in self-reported and objective sleep measures are common, but poorly understood. This study characterizes the accuracy of sleep perceptions and psychosocial correlates of discrepancies among people with advanced cancer. METHOD(S): Twenty individuals with advanced cancers enrolling into a cognitive behavioral intervention for worry, uncertainty, and insomnia completed sleep diaries, wore actigraphy watches, and completed questionnaires assessing sleep (ISI), psychological outcomes (CES-D, PSWQ, STAI), and psychotropic medication use. Pearson's correlations were used for data exploration. RESULT(S): Participants reported sleep duration averaging 6 h and 29 min and a sleep onset latency of 45 min (SD=35.6), perceived multiple sleep awakenings (M=2.3 instances, SD=0.74; M perceived duration=46.0 min, SD=42.3), and rated their insomnia as moderately severe. Reported sources of awakenings included urination, pain, and worry. Participants underestimated total nightly sleep by 40.6 min (SD=77.1) and overestimated sleep onset latency by 28.6 min (SD=34.7).Overestimation of sleep onset latency was associatedwith lower education (r=-0.53, p<0.01) and higher state anxiety (r=0.47, p<0.05). Perceiving more awakenings was associated with greater worry (r=0.43, p<0.05). Inaccurate bedtime perception was associated with generalized anxiety symptoms (r=0.60, p<0.05). Antidepressant use was associated with longer actigraphy sleep onset latency (r = 0.43). CONCLUSION(S): Sleep perceptions are not consistent with actigraphy recordings among cancer patients and are associated with anxiety and worry, potential targets for effective insomnia intervention. Some antidepressants may contribute to sleep onset difficulties. Research Implications: Individuals with cancer rate their insomnia as problematic but often misperceive the extent of their sleep difficulties. Our results outline cooccurring psychological symptoms, which may be important therapeutic targets during studies of treatment of insomnia. Practice Implications: Effective management of insomnia is important for patient well-being. This study identifies additional areas of focus (misperceptions of sleep, worry, and anxiety) for insomnia treatment in individuals with advanced disease.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,*sleep;*actimetry;*recording;*advanced cancer;*oncology;human;insomnia;patient worry;latent period;anxiety;arousal;cancer patient;Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale;education;dysuria;sleep time;wellbeing;neoplasm;patient;drug therapy;questionnaire;antidepressant agent;psychotropic agent,,,,Exploring discrepancies in self-reported sleep and actigraphy recording among individuals with advanced cancer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Akbar, University of Michigan Addiction Research Center, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, United States","Activity monitoring is a commonly used method in sleep research to assess sleep/wake patterns. Actigraphy is a computerized wristwatch-like device that collects movementgenerated data, which is then transformed into information regarding sleep/wake patterns using validated algorithms. Typically, daily self-reported bedtime (BT) and wakeup time (WT) are used to determine the window available for sleep (i.e., time in bed). However, selfreported BT and WT typically differ from actigraphy-measured BT and WT, resulting in disparate sleep measures. It is unclear whether this disparity could be associated with the home environment leading to exaggerated or attenuated group effects when comparing children from high and low risk homes. This study assessed inter-method reliability of sleep quality in children from alcoholic (COA) and nonalcoholic (NCOA) families, comparing the basic actigraphy algorithm to actigraphy analyzed using self-reported BT and WT. Participants were 32 COAs (age 10.5+/-1.3 yr) and 11 NCOAs (11+/-1.2 yr). Data collection included participants' daily self-reported sleep logs and actigraphy. BT and WT from sleep logs were then combined with actigraphy and compared with the raw output of the software algorithm, which relies solely on level of movement. Time in bed (TIB), total sleep time (TST), sleep onset latency (SOL), and wake after sleep onset (WASO) derived using the two methods were compared using repeated measures ANOVAs. Self-reported TIB was significantly higher than raw actigraphy-measured TIB (p < 0.01). Additionally, COAs spent significantly less TIB compared to NCOAs (p = 0.004) across methods, with no interaction. Conversely, TST measured using the two methods was not significantly different (p = 0.17), with TST in COAs significantly lower than in NCOAs (p = 0.02), and no interaction. SOL and WASO were greater when using self-report diaries (p < 0.01), with no group effect or interactions. These findings suggest that the use of sleep logs to analyze actigraphy increases SOL and WASO estimations, due to greater TIB, but does not impact TST estimation. However, this bias did not interact with parents' alcoholism history, suggesting it did not confound sleep disturbance measures. Finally, while the basic actigraphy algorithm underestimated TIB, these data confirm that COAs have less sleep compared to controls using both objective and subjective measures of sleep.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,*actimetry;*alcoholism;*society;*reliability;*children of alcoholics;sleep;algorithm;human;child;home environment;risk;computer program;sleep time;latent period;self report;sleep quality;parent;sleep disorder;monitoring;device;information processing;Only Child;Child;Alcoholics,,,,Methodological reliability in the use of actigraphy in children of alcoholic families,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Past studies have demonstrated the importance of measuring sleep parameters in both averages and variabilities using subjective and objective methods. Thus, we aimed to compare the averages and variability of sleep parameters in people with T2D with and without insomnia symptoms. Method(s): Actigraph measurements and sleep diaries were used in 59 participants to assess sleep parameters, including sleep efficiency (SE), sleep latency, total sleep time, and wake after sleep onset over seven nights. Validated instruments were used to assess the symptoms of depression, anxiety, and pain. Circular data were used to describe the distribution of bed distribution with SE as a magnitude for both groups. Mann Whitney U test was utilized to compare averages and variability of sleep parameters between the two groups. Multivariable general linear model to control for demographic and clinical variables. For the secondary aim, multiple linear regression tests were utilized to assess the association between averages and variability values for both groups. Result(s): SE was found to be lower in average and higher in variability for participants with T2D and insomnia symptoms, than those with T2D only subjectively and objectively. SE variability was also the only sleep parameter higher in people with T2D and insomnia symptoms, with psychological symptoms potentially playing a role in this difference. We observed that people in T2D+Insomnia tend to go to bed earlier compared to the T2D only group based on objective measures, but no difference was observed between groups in subjective measures. The only significant relationship in both objective and subjective measures was between the averages and variability of SE. Conclusion(s): Our findings suggest a discrepancy between subjective and objective measures in only average of total sleep time, as well as agreement in measures of variability in sleep parameters. Also, the relationship between averages and variabilities suggested the importance of improving SE to minimize its variability. Further research is warranted to investigate the complex relationship between sleep parameters and psychological factors in people with T2D and insomnia symptoms.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,actigraph;adult;anxiety;conference abstract;controlled study;demography;depression;female;human;*insomnia;major clinical study;male;night;*non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus;pain;psychological aspect;rank sum test;*sleep efficiency;sleep latency;sleep time;Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders;Sleep,,,,Sleep parameters in people with type 2 diabetes with and without insomnia symptoms,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ageing is also associated with changes in sleep and circadian rhythms, such as greater nocturnal sleep fragmentation and daytime sleepiness. Some studies show possible association between frailty and poor sleep quality, while daytime sleepiness has been linked with poor functional recovery in older adults. There are little data on hospitalized older adult sleep quality, duration and associated perceptions. We compared perceived versus objective sleep quality and duration in long-stay hospital inpatients (older adults) to inform clinical management strategies and interventions. Material(s) and Method(s): Long-stay (2+ weeks) older adults over 64 years admitted to the Assessment Treatment and Rehabilitation ward (Dunedin Public Hospital) able to give an informed consent were invited to participate in the study. We collected actigraphy (Actilife GT3X) data (7+days), subjective sleep questionnaire Pittsburgh Sleep quality index (PSQI) and a research-team designed qualitative sleep questionnaire on sleep perceptions. Demographic, hospital stay and clinical data were collected. Descriptive statistics for the study sample were derived, and paired t-tests to compare subjective and objective sleep measures were used. Thematic analysis was performed on the qualitative data. We are currently conducting additional analyses, incorporating quality of life measures. Result(s): Data were collected on 35 older adults, each of whom contributed mean (SD) 11.4 (8.1) days of actigraphy data. 54.3% were female with mean (SD) age of 79.8 (7.2) years and 87% identified as New Zealand European. Mean (SD) length of hospital stay was 21.0 (9.6) days. 42.0% and 42.0% were admitted for reconditioning following medical illness or stroke. For all patients on the ward, the average (SD) length of sleep as captured by actigraphy was 8.2 (1.7) hours. Average (SD) sleep latency was 5.3 (6.5) minutes. Patients significantly underestimated the duration of sleep, comparing to actigraphy measurements (p=0.02). 26 study participants contributed qualitative data. 50.0%, 42.3% and 30.8% patients described their sleep as fragmented, delayed or short, respectively. 23.1%, 50.0% and 57.7% of the study participants mentioned pre-sleep routine, quiet room or acceptance of their state as factors that help them sleep, respectively, while 53.9%, 50.0%, 38.5% listed noise, other patients or interruptions from nurses, as the key factors that negatively affect sleep. Internal factors, such as ""not feeling at home"", ""other life concerns"" and ""repetitive thoughts"", ""health concerns"" and ""pain and disease"" were listed as they key factors that negatively affect sleep by 38.5%, 34.6%, 26.9% and 23.1%, respectively. 53.9%, 19.2% and 15.4% of the participants mentioned hospital setting, sickness or age as factors that negatively influenced sleep quality and duration expectations, respectively. 46.2% of the patients stated feeling lack of control; 61.5% and 50.0% mentioned acceptance and ability to adjust as the main themes. Conclusion(s): Multiple factors impact on inpatient sleep, and large proportion of patients have negative perceptions and expectations on their sleep.

Method(s): A prospective observational study involving 36 quasiconsecutive patients (20 males, mean age 72 yrs, range 51-91), with severe airway obstruction (FEV1/FVC 45% SD+/-10) during 41 admissions. Usual sleep at home and daily sleep in hospital was assessed by use of questionnaires, Likert scale for quality of sleep, nurse observations and actigraphy. Result(s): There were 140 admission days, 40 in single room and 100 in 4 bed cubicles. Average length of stay was 5 days (range 1 to 30). There was no significant difference in age and severity of airway obstruction between men and women. Bed time and wake up time were earlier in hospital by 33 min (95%CI 5-72 min) and 21 min (95% CI 1.5-44 min) respectively. Latency to sleep was significantly longer in hospital (mean difference 43 minutes, 95%CI 29-58 minutes). Total sleep time (TST) assessed subjectively was significantly reduced compared to home by 2 hours and 26 minutes (95%CI 2.4-2 hrs). Subjects overestimated TST by 54 min (95%CI 22-87 min) compared to actigraphy TST. There was no difference in sleep latency and TST between sleep in single room compared to 4 bed cubicles. There was no correlation between severity of airway obstruction measure (FEV1/ FVC) and total sleep time. Perceived sleep quality did not improve between the first day of admission and up to 10 days stay. The number of awakenings through the night was higher in hospital than at home (mean difference 1.2, 95% CI 0.8-1.5) and in 4 bed cubicles than in single room (4 and 2 respectively). The most common reasons for sleep fragmentation were voiding, nurse intervention and noise. Lunch and dinner were earlier in hospital by 1.30 and 1 hour respectively. Conclusion(s): In patients with severe COPD, admission to hospital is associated with severe disruption of sleep continuity, length and daily routine. Attention and modification of some of the identified factors associated with sleep disruption may be beneficial to patients' care.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,"*sleep;*human;*patient;*ward;*chronic obstructive lung disease;hospital;airway obstruction;male;sleep time;nurse;actimetry;female;observational study;questionnaire;length of stay;latent period;sleep quality;arousal;night;noise;Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive",,,,Quality and quantity of sleep in patients with copd admitted to an acute respiratory ward,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Arora, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom","Introduction: Self-reported sleep duration is widely used but may not provide accurate information. Correlations between objective estimates of sleep and self-reported data only demonstrate if a relationship is present but do not determine if the two measures agree. We sought to determine levels of agreement between two self-reported average weekday sleep duration measures and one objective estimate (actigraphy) of average weekday sleep duration. Method(s): Students (n=642), aged 11-13 years, were recruited from eight secondary schools in the Midlands region of the UK. The Schools Sleep Habits Survey was administered to obtain self-reported weekday sleep duration (WSD). Immediately after completion, students wore wrist actigraphy ( GT3X+) for 7 consecutive days whilst also completing a 7-day sleep diary. Result(s): Mean weekday sleep duration+/-SD (minutes) according to selfreport, sleep diary and actigraphy were 534+/-76, 527+/-44, and 448+/-47, respectively. A positive correlation was observed between self-reported WSD and actigraphy measured average WSD r=0.19, p=0.01. Average sleep diary WSD was positively correlated with average actigraphy WSD r=0.31, p<0.001. Bland-Altman plots showed a mean of 82.9 and a region of agreement between self-reported average WSD and mean actigraphy WSD of 219.3 to -53.5 with nine data points falling outside of the upper and lower bound limits. A further Bland-Altman plot revealed a mean of 76.2 and a region of agreement between average sleep diary WSD and average actigraphy-measured WSD of 183.6 to -31.2 with >95% of the data falling within the levels of agreement.

Both self-reported measures of average weekday sleep duration in adolescents agreed with objectively determined average WSD data with 95% of the data falling within the levels of agreement when graphically plotted. Self-reported WSD may be conidently used as a cost-eficient method in future studies.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,*sleep time;*sleep;*human;*organization;*adolescent;*United Kingdom;actimetry;student;wrist;habit;school;high school;Adolescent,,,,Validation of two self-reported sleep duration measures against objective estimates of sleep duration in a large UK adolescent cohort,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We aimed to examine this mismatch and investigate the characteristics associated with the mismatch in insomnia patients. Method(s): In 121 insomnia patients, findings of nocturnal polysomnography, responses to a subjective questionnaire after sleep, and medical records were reviewed. The patients were classified into two groups-total sleep time (TST) underestimation group (N=56) and TST non-underestimation group (N=65)-depending on the presence of a 2-h difference between the subjective and the objective TSTs. The demographic characteristics, type of insomnia, use of sleep-promoting medication, polysomnography findings, and subjective reports were compared between the two groups. Result(s): Nocturnal polysomnography showed significantly longer TST(p<0.001) and shorter sleep latency (p< 0.001) than the subjectively reported values. In comparison with the TST non-underestimation group, the TST underestimation group were significantly older (p=0.043) more likely to have longer TST(p=0.012), shorter sleep latency (p=0.002), and a smaller proportion of slow-wave sleep (p<0.001) in the polysomnographic analysis and more likely to show shorter TST(p<0.001) and shallower sleep(p<0.001) in the subjectively reported values. Conclusion(s): We found a significant mismatch between the subjective perception and the objective findings of sleep time as determined using polysomnography in insomnia patients. Underestimation of sleep time may be more closely associated with the proportion of slow-wave sleep, which reflects sleep depth, than with objective TST.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,adult;controlled study;female;human;*insomnia;major clinical study;male;medical record;*perception;polysomnography;questionnaire;sleep latency;*sleep time;slow wave sleep;conference abstract;Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders,,,,Mismatch between subjective perception and objective findings on sleep time in insomnia patients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Method(s): Data analysis from an app that offers sleep assessment based on questionnaires and 7 days collection: (1) Measured sleep schedule including bedtime, wake up time, intended wake up time. (2) Reported sleep latency, wake time after sleep onset, total sleep time, perceived sleep quality upon awakening, previous day napping, stress, and daytime sleepiness. (3) Measured sleep architecture based on validated Heart Rate Variability analysis: Sleep Latency (SO), NREM I and II, NREM III, REM, and Wake After Sleep Onset (WASO), Total Sleep Time, Sleep Efficiency (SE), fragmentation (autonomic arousals), and stress (sympatho-vagal balance). (4) Ambient noise and snoring. The evaluation is followed by a personalized Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia administered automatically and adjusted in weekly cycles. Result(s): During 15 months, starting November 2014, 130 subjects (age 49.8 +/- 13.1, 58% men) completed a sleep assessment based on both objective and subjective data. Only 109 started the offered CBTI, and completed at least 1 week of therapy. The adherence to therapy decreased with time: 76% completed 2 weeks, 49% did 3 weeks, only 21% did 4 weeks. SO and WASO were overestimated, and SE was underestimated during the initial assessment. Both subjective and objective SO, WASO, and SE improved significantly with CBTI, while objective-subjective discrepancies decreased, suggesting that objective sleep monitoring may improve Insomnia management. Conclusion(s): Mobile technology may facilitate efficient large scale self-help for Insomnia. Objective sleep measures should be considered in Insomnia management.

The goal of this study was to investigate the effects of PAP therapy on SSM. Method(s): A retrospective review was performed between January 2010-April 2011 on patients (>18yo) who received PAP for the treatment of OSA. Both demographic and polysomnographic (PSG) variables were obtained. The ratio of subjective to objective total sleep time (TST) was calculated and SSM was deined as a deviation of >12.5% from the mean. This threshold was used based on the assumption that a misperception >1 out of 8 hours of sleep is clinically signiicant. SSM was calculated for baseline and PAP studies. Demographic and PSG variables were analyzed to identify subjects who remained under-perceivers during PAP. Result(s): In total, 302 patients were identiied: 64% were male, mean age 50.2 +/- 13.2 years, and mean BMI 35.1 +/- 9.1kg/m2. On baseline PSG: 47% had no misperception, 28% over-perceived and 25% of subjects under-perceived TST. Following PAP, TST perception improved in 58% of previous under-perceivers. Compared to others, the 32 subjects (43%) who remained under-perceivers after PAP were younger (42.9 +/- 11.2 vs. 51.1 +/- 13.2 years, p<0.001), had shorter sleep latency (14.6 +/- 12.3 vs. 24.1 +/- 23.3 mins, p=0.001), and lower Apnea/Hypopnea Index (AHI; 10.9 +/- 5.2 vs. 14.1 +/- 11.3, p=0.008). No difference was found in Epworth Sleepiness Scale (10.3 +/- 5.0 vs. 9.7 +/- 5.0, p=0.54). A regression model found that older age was independently associated with lower risk for remaining an under-perceiver of TST, OR=0.96 [95%CI=0.94-0.98). Conclusion(s): Over half of the OSA patients who under-perceive TST on a diagnostic PSG will improve perception following PAP titration.

However, little research has focused on methods of identifying individuals with short sleep duration and treatments to extend sleep duration. The goal of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of objective short sleep duration among adults with prehypertension, to determine the accuracy of self-reported screening procedures aimed at identifying participants who would benefit from a sleep extension intervention. Potential participants were identified from an electronic medical record search based on having at least one office blood pressure reading above 120/80 in the past year. Exclusionary criteria included antihypertensive or hypnotic medications, sleep disorder diagnosis based on chart review or high risk for a sleep disorder based on questionnaires (obstructive sleep apnea, insomnia or restless legs syndrome). Participants completed questionnaires, 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and 7 days of wrist actigraphy. The sample includes 24 participants (15 females, 9 males, age m= 44 SD=8 years). Average self-reported sleep duration was 5.8 (SD= 0.9) hours and average objective sleep duration was 6.4 (SD=0.8) hours. On average, participants' self-reported sleep duration underestimated objective sleep duration by 0.6 hours. The correlation between self-report and objective sleep duration was moderate (r= 0.40, p<.05) and the majority of participants who self-reported short sleep duration also had objective short sleep duration (74%). The strongest objective sleep predictors of objective short sleep duration were lower time in bed (r=0.94, p<0.001), later bedtime (r=-0.42, p<0.05) and lower sleep efficiency (r=0.46, p<0.05). Sleep duration was not associated with wake after sleep onset or sleep latency. Results suggest that the majority of participants with self-reported short sleep duration also have objective short sleep duration. Time in bed and late bedtime are key targets for interventions focused on extending sleep among individuals with short sleep duration in the absence of comorbid sleep disorders.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,actimetry;adult;blood pressure monitoring;clinical article;diagnosis;electronic medical record;female;human;human tissue;insomnia;male;medical record review;*prehypertension;prevalence;questionnaire;restless legs syndrome;self report;sleep deprivation;sleep disordered breathing;sleep latency;*sleep quality;sleep time;wrist;antihypertensive agent;conference abstract;Sleep,,,,Objective sleep characteristics of selfreported short sleepers with prehypertension/stage I hypertension,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Barreto, UNIFESP, Brazil","Introduction: Sleep State Misperception (SSM) is the current diagnostic termfor the intriguing group of insomnia patients who appear unable to discriminate sleep from wakefulness. Historically, it has been among the most challenging sleep disorders to understand and clinically manage. According to the International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD), SSM, which was recently renamed ""Paradoxical Insomnia"", is a disorder in which a complaint of severe insomnia occurs without any objective evidence of sleep disturbance and without a significant impairment of daytime function. The present study aims to identify the psychosocial features of patients with SSM. Method(s): The study population included SSM patients fromthe Neuro-Sono Sleep Center, Department of Neurology, Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo, Brazil. Semi-structured interviews were conducted following a script of questions with regard to birthplace, family, childhood, sleep, moves, present life and perceptions. A content analysis of the interviews was performed, with a specific focus on the interviewees' feelings, thoughts, and social and familiar insertion. Result(s): A total of 60 patients, with 33 females and an age range of 23 to 76 years old, with a confirmed diagnosis of SSM were identified fromamong 2000 medical files and 1735 PSG studies. Eighty percent of the SSM patients were not natives of Sao Paulo City. In all patients, the severity of the nocturnal complaint was not confirmed by evidence of pathologic sleepiness, marked performance decrements, or other severe functional impairments during the day that are typically seen in cases of such marked sleep deprivation. Sleep stages 1 and 2 were longer in the SSM patients than among people without any sleep complaints. One patient had an autoimmune disease, and two had syndromes affecting perception. The data collected from 20 interviews revealed several shared features in these patients: unsafe and threatening environments; uprooted feelings; complacent and methodical behavior; proactiveness, resilience, and rootlessness; and recurrent feelings of loss and grief. These patients related concerns about the long-term effects of their perceived sleep deficits on their general health and longevity. Conclusion(s): The psychosocial features of SSM patients are important components for their diagnosis and treatment. The observations in this study could potentially help to determine a psychological and clinical profile of SSM patients. In addition, the psychosocial features found in this study are likely not restricted to Brazilian culture, but are probably found in SSM patients from other cultures,whichwill necessitate equivalent studies in different cultures.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,"*patient;*sleep;insomnia;sleep disorder;diagnosis;interview;somnolence;functional disease;sleep deprivation;sleep stage;autoimmune disease;environment;grief;health;wakefulness;classification;population;neurology;longevity;semi structured interview;birthplace;childhood;content analysis;female;city;Brazil;Sleep Disorders, Intrinsic",,,,Psychosocial features of Brazilian patients with sleep state misperception,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Activation of inlammatory pathways may represent the pathophysiological link between sleep disruption and its medical and psychological impact. Despite the importance of sleep in the obstetrical population, there are no published studies deinitively linking objective measures of sleep architecture disruption with maternal and neonatal outcomes. Method(s): This is a prospective observational study of healthy pregnant subjects through their entire pregnancy. Subjects wore the Zeo home device headband for 7-10 nights per trimester. Zeo-derived total sleep time (TST), sleep latency (SL), and sleep stage duration, were averaged within trimesters for each subject. Subjective TST and SL were obtained from patient diaries. Trimester differences were tested using One-way ANOVA with a post-test for a linear trend. Result(s): Out of 17 consented patients, we present results from seven subjects who completed all three trimesters of monitoring. Wake time and SL did not change between trimesters, although we found a trend towards decreased TST (minutes) (p=0.10): 461+/-15 (1st trimester), 433+/-21(2nd trimester) and 415+/-20 (3rd trimester). Interestingly, subjective/diary TST remained stable over the trimesters, indicating overestimation of TST compared to objective data. Absolute duration of REM sleep signiicantly decreased across trimesters (mean +/- SEM in 1st, 2nd and 3rd trimester: 136.8+/-8.1 min, 126.2+/-9.9 min, and 97+/- 9.1min; ANOVA p=0.015; post-test for linear trend p=0.005). The percentage of REM sleep similarly decreased over the course of pregnancy (1st, 2nd and 3rd trimester: 29.4+/-1.2%, 28.6+/-1.7% and 22.9+/-1.2%; ANOVA p=0.005; post-test for linear trend p=0.0025). In contrast, absolute duration of light NR and deep NR did not change across pregnancy. Conclusion(s): We report a novel approach to objective sleep assessment during pregnancy, using a home device allowing longitudinal, prospective, objective sleep analysis. Our hypothesis is that severity of sleep disruption during pregnancy correlates with adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes. Preliminary results suggest longitudinal alterations in gestational TST and sleep architecture. Once enrollment is complete we will extend our analysis to the correlation between sleep disturbance and maternal and neonatal outcome, with the aim of identifying sleep-related markers of obstetric risk.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,*sleep;*organization;*pregnancy;female;human;patient;REM sleep;architecture;risk;devices;sleep disorder;analysis of variance;hypothesis;observational study;second trimester pregnancy;monitoring;population;sleep stage;sleep time;night;marker;Pregnancy;Sleep,,,,Sleep evolution during pregnancy: Possible relation to maternal/fetal outcomes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Research Design: From a larger prospective cohort of youth of 5-18 years of age with post-concussive injury, preliminary analysis of 12 participants with self-reported sleep disturbance were evaluated using accelerometers. Method(s): Participants completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) every 48 hours and also had sleep measured via accelerometry. Measurements included counts per hour of time in bed, efficiency, average awake time and number of awakenings per hour of sleep. Correlations were conducted matching PSQI scores to consecutive nights of accelerometry assessment. Result(s): Accelerometer-measured median (range) sleep efficiency was 80.7% (67.3-87.2%), with normal sleep defined as >85%. The median PSQI score was 11 (2-16) out of 21, with a recommended cut-off of >5 indicating subjective insomnia. PSQI scores were poorly correlated with actigraph sleep recordings, and only average number of awakenings was significant (r = -0.3; p = 0.035). Conclusion(s): Preliminary results from this ongoing data analysis suggest that the PSQI and accelerometry may be measuring different attributes of sleep. Both may be needed as actual sleep is important but so is perception of good sleep. These findings call for further validity testing of objective sleep assessment measures like accelerometry, as well as commonly used self-report tools.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,accelerometer;accelerometry;adult;arousal;clinical article;*concussion;data analysis;female;human;insomnia;*juvenile;male;perception;Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index;*questionnaire;self report;*sleep quality;validity;wakefulness;young adult;Questionnaires;Adolescent,,,,Exploring accelerometery versus questionnaire assessment of sleep in youth with concussion,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Berkowitz Sturgis, Psychiatry, University of Pennylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States","Introduction: Sleep State Misperception has been conceptualized as a transdiagnostic phenomenon which exists on a continuum. On the one end, there is the phenomenon of adequate and normal PSG sleep which is perceived as poor sleep. On the other end, there is the phenomenon of abnormal PSG sleep which is perceived as good sleep. Several ideas have been advanced to account for these phenomena, ranging from the differential presence of high frequency EEG activity within standard PSG signals, to alterations in the mesograde amnesia of normal sleep, to variability in perceptibility of sleep by stage of sleep. In the present analysis, this last possibility is re-visited. Method(s): PSGs, scored in a standardized fashion by the Penn Clinical Research Center for Sleep, were identiied from on-going insomnia studies. AM Diaries were acquired from each subject and Subjective- Objective (Sub-Ob) discrepancy scores were calculated for Sleep Latency, Wake After Sleep Onset and for Total Sleep Time (e.g., Sub-Ob-SL= sSL-oSL). The assessment of sleep architecture predictors of Sub-Ob scores was accomplished using linear regression anaysis with co-variates for age and sex. The sample was comprised of 30 PIs (Age 35.3 +/- 9.6, 70% female) and 12 GSs (Age 36.9 +/-1 1.7, 75% female). Result(s): When taking into account both Good Sleepers and subjects with Insomnia, it was found that 1) the larger the Sub-Ob-SL, the more STG2 minutes (Sub-Ob-SL: [B=0.51,p=0.044] and 2) the larger the Sub-Ob-TST the more the STG2 minutes and STG2 percent and the lower the SWS% (Sub-Ob-TST: STG2 min [B=-0.80,p<0.001]; STG2% [B=-4.29,p=0.002]; and SWS% [B=2.69,p=0.047]). Conclusion(s): These indings suggest that STG2 is not, while proportion of time spent in SWS may be, readily perceived as sleep in the AM.

Improved understanding of the relation between sleep architecture (stages, fragmentation, etc) and subjective-objective mismatch might yield important diagnostic and prognostic information. We hypothesized that the degree of mismatch among insomnia patients would correlate with metrics of sleep fragmentation. Method(s): We performed a retrospective analysis of ~1000 patients undergoing diagnostic polysomnography at our center. Patients completed a post-study estimate of sleep latency, total sleep time, and certainty regarding each answer. We excluded those with neurological or psychiatric diseases, or those taking any medication influencing sleep (final n=312). Insomnia category was defined by self-reported on intake questionnaire, yielding 3 groups: insomnia alone, sleep apnea alone (AHI >5), or both. Result(s): While a mismatch between subjective report of sleep (latency and total sleep time) was evident in all groups, it was most pronounced in insomnia patients who more substantially underestimated their sleep. We found significant correlations between subjective-objective mismatch of total sleep time, and fragmentation indices (such as EEG arousals, brief awakenings, sleep efficiency, periodic leg movements, and respiratory events) (0.2 to 0.35, Spearman's R). The extent of sleep underestimation was inversely related to certainty, suggesting a tendency toward pessimism when guessing. However, errors in latency showed only small correlation with errors in total sleep, arguing against a general ""exaggerator"" phenotype. We also observed that subjective sleep duration (across a range of accuracy) correlated best with the duration of REM sleep and of N2. We present different weighting schemes applied to sleep stage metrics to use architecture to predict self-reported sleep duration. Conclusion(s): Subjective-objective mismatch, which was common in patients reporting insomnia, correlated with several fragmentation metrics. Additionally, the prediction of self-reported sleep duration based on sleep stages suggests possible mechanistic links between sleep architecture and subjective estimation of sleep duration.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,*sleep;*sleep time;*architecture;*organization;human;patient;insomnia;arousal;latent period;diagnosis;sleep stage;REM sleep;pessimism;self report;periodic limb movement disorder;sleep disordered breathing;questionnaire;phenotype;mental disease;polysomnography;prediction;drug therapy;electroencephalogram;Sleep,,,,Sleep architecture predicts the mismatch between subjective and objective sleep duration,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Blunden, Central Queensland University, Australia","Background: Sleep knowledge and parental perceptions of infant sleep vary considerably among parents of infants. Parents can report their infant as having a severe sleep problem despite objective methods often differing from subjective measurements. This might suggest that parents are misinterpreting sleep as a problem when in fact it is a normal sleep pattern. This can have clinical implications and lead to a sleep intervention instead of a basic psychoeducation and further can impact significantly on the mental health of parents. This study aimed to assess whether parents can accurately identify a sleep problem in their child. Method(s): Whilst data collection is ongoing, to date, 15 families with infants aged 6-12 months have measured their infants' sleep using actigraphy, and the Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire (BISQ). Parents responded to the question Do you consider your child's sleep as a problem? (A very serious problem, A small problem and Not a problem at all). These ratings were compared to the objective data to assess if the sleep patterns of the infant could be considered problematic compared to normative data. Result(s): Data collection is still ongoing but preliminary data analysis, suggest that parents overestimate sleep problems such as night wakings and sleep duration. and that there is a difference between the objective and subjective measurements of infant sleep. Conclusion(s): Parental perceptions of their infants' sleep is in accurate. Furthermore, parents who believe their infant has problematic sleep may be in need of psychoeducation rather than costly sleep interventions. This suggests a need for a clinical understanding of parental perceptions of sleep and a need for sleep education in new families providing the required support to parents in a clinical setting.

Method(s): Cross-sectional study of 107 NH patients. Sleep was objectively measured with actigraphy for 7 days, by NH staff who registered bed and rise times. Sleep disturbances identified by proxyraters were defined as scores >=1 for sleep items in the Cornell scale for depression (CSDD) and >=4 for the sleep item in the neuropsychiatric inventory - nursing home version (NPI-NH). For actigraphy measures, a > 30 min cut-off defined sleep onset latency (SOL) and early morning awakening (EMA), while >=3 wake bouts (NoW) and < 85% sleep efficiency (SE) were used to define sleep disturbances. Result(s): 88% of NH patients had sleep efficiency < 85% (mean SE=65%) and actigraphy detected sleep disturbances in 45% (SOL, mean=56 min), 96% (NoW, mean=33) and 56% (EMA, mean= 52 min). Proxy raters reported sleep disturbances in 23% of patients assessed with NPI-NH and 20%, 45% and 17% (SOL, NoW and EMA) assessed with CSDD. McNemar's test revealed significant differences (P < 0.001) between the objective actigraphy measures and the subjective NPI-NH measure for sleep and the CSDD measures for SOL, NoW and EMA. Conclusion(s): Sleep disturbances measured with actigraphy were widespread among NH patients.

Neuroimaging research suggests an association between frontal systems integrity and the capacity to experience sleep as restorative. We examined discrepancies between perceived and objective sleep quality, PTSD, and indices of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) in returning veterans with blast exposure, using subjective (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Inventory, PSQI) and objective (actigraphy, ACT) measures. Design(s): Cross-sectional study. Setting(s): Outpatient research unit. Participant(s): Fifty-five veterans with blast exposure. Intervention(s): N/A. Main Outcome Measure(s): Participants completed the PSQI and PTSD Checklist (PCL-M), and underwent 7 days of continuous actigraphic monitoring. Clinical diagnoses of PTSD (CAPS) and duration of posttraumatic amnesia (PTA) were obtained. Absolute sleep discrepancy between PSQI- and ACT-measured Total Sleep Time (SD-TST) was calculated. Result(s): Almost a third (27%) of the participants under or overestimated TST by two or more hours. Results showed significant positive correlations between SD-TST and PCL-M and post-traumatic amnesia (PTA). Followup analyses revealed that the positive parametric relationship between PTA and SD-TST was only significant in the group with high levels of selfreported PTSD (PCL>50) (n=31) or a PTSD diagnosis (n=39). These results suggest that increased PTA severity is associated with increased sleep discrepancy in veterans with PTSD, but not in veterans without PTSD. Conclusion(s): These findings highlight the prevalence of sleep misperceptions in returning veteran populations with exposure to blast. Our results suggest that increased PTA severity might be associated with exaggerated sleep misperceptions in PTSD patients. Discrepancies between objective and subjective sleep measures might reflect clinically meaningful correlates of neuropsychiatric status and TBI severity.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,*veteran;*sleep;*human;*American;*rehabilitation medicine;*actimetry;*posttraumatic stress disorder;exposure;sleep quality;amnesia;diagnosis;Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index;sleep time;traumatic brain injury;monitoring;checklist;outpatient;cross-sectional study;population;neuroimaging;prevalence;follow up;patient;injury;Veterans;Sleep,,,,Sleep misperceptions in blast-exposed OEF/OIF/OND veterans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study evaluated feasibility of objectively measuring physiologic sleep quality in college students via self-administered electrocardiographic (ECG) recordings obtained fromthe student's natural home environment. Participant(s): College students (N = 83) completing a consecutive 2-night sleep study in fall and spring semesters. Method(s): Participants were instructed on a procedure for wearing a sleep data recorder device (SleepImage, Broomfield CO) to collect biometric data that included autonomic measures of sleep (heart rate variability and ECG-derived respiration rate), snore, and actigraphy data during sleep at home. The standard self-report Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index and a 4-item Alcohol Use Survey was also administered for comparisons of objective and subjective sleep measurements in abstinent, moderate, and heavy drinkers. Result(s): ECG data were successfully obtained in 82 (98.8%) participants. Cardiopulmonary coupling analysis of ECGs differentiated between stable and unstable non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep levels. Over 40%of students exhibited insufficient nightly levels of stable NREMsleep and physiologically unhealthy or poor sleep quality. However, discordance between self-rated versus physiologically measured sleep quality occurred in >50%of cases. The level of past 30-day drinking played a significant role in student's impaired self-perception of sleep quality. Conclusion(s): Results highlight the cardiopulmonary coupling technique as a practical approach providing real-time biomarker measurements of sleep quality in young adults in college and, importantly, enabling the quantitative analysis of alcohol-sleep interactions in this at-risk population for alcohol-related sleep dysfunction.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,actimetry;adult;alcohol consumption;breathing rate;college student;cross coupling reaction;drinking;eye movement;feasibility study;*female;heart rate variability;home environment;human;major clinical study;*male;*night sleep;perception;Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index;quantitative analysis;self report;*sleep quality;spring;young adult;alcohol;biological marker,,,,Impact of alcoholon physiologic sleep quality variables: Cardiopulmonary coupled sleep analysis in young collegiate adults,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study is to investigate the agreement between mothers' subjective reports of infants sleeping problems and objective sleep parameters obtained with actigraphy. Material(s) and Method(s): Mothers filled out a questionnaire about infants sleep and strapped on their infant's ankle an actigraph for a period of 7 days. Data were obtained for 29 infants (57.1% girls) twice, i.e., when babies were 3 and 6 months old. Result(s): 3-month-old infants described by their mothers has having sleeping problems, who gave bad nights and who had difficulties falling asleep (items added as a Sleep factor) showed less sleep efficiency (r = -.379; p = .021), less actual sleep time percentage (r = -.418, p = .012), more actual wake time percentage asleep (r = .426, p = .011), less immobile percentage asleep (r = -.329; p = .041) and more moving time percentage asleep (r = .342; p = .035). These infants also revealed higher total activity score (r = .448; p = .007), mean activity score (r = .462, p = .006) and mean score in active asleep (r = .451; p = .007) as measured by actigraphy. These consistent associations were not observed in 6-month-old babies. The vast majority of 6-month-old infants slept in parents room (own crib; n = 14; 51.9%) or own room (n = 11; 40.7%) while nearly all 3-month-old infants slept in parents room (own crib; n = 26, 89.7%). Conclusion(s): Agreement between subjective and objective estimations of sleep was particularly observed in 3-month-old babies. A possible explanation for this result is that mothers are more aware of their infants sleeping problems when their babies sleep in parents room. nowledgements: AstraZeneca Foundation for financial support.

Castelnovo, Sleep and Epilepsy Center, Neurocenter of Southern Switzerland, Civic Hospital, Lugano, Switzerland","Introduction: Paradoxical insomnia, otherwise known as ""misperceptive insomnia?, is definitively the most intriguing yet challenging subtype of insomnia. However, the boundaries of this insomnia subtype remain blurred. A Mispeception Index (MI) was validated by our group as the difference between objective and subjective Total Sleep Time (o-TST and s-TST) divided by the o-TST. The statistical analysis of the distribution of MI in insomnia patients disclosed the presence of two subgroups of insomnia patients (High Misperceptive (HM) and Moderate Misperceptive (MM), discriminated by an MI cut-off of 0.9 (Manconi et al., 2010). We herein want to investigate whether the two populations identified by MI differed in terms of psychopathology and estimation abilities. Method(s): CET (Cognitive Estimation Task) and MMPI-2 (Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory - 2nd version)were available for a database of 245 chronic primary insomnia collected at the Centre of Sleep Medicine, San Raffaele Scientific Institute of Milan. Data analysis was performed in SPSS using parametric testing after controlling for normality of data distribution. Level of significance was set to 0.05. Result(s): HM patients committed more estimation errors as measured by CET scores than MM patients, t(230) = -2.632, p = 0.009, twotailed independent samples t-test. No statistically significant difference between HM and MM emerged on the on the combined dependent variables, represented by the clinical sub-items of MMPI-2, using a one-way between-groups MANOVA. When the results for the dependent variables were considered separately, only depression reached statistical significance, F(1,173) = 3897, p = 0.05 (HM>;MM). Conclusion(s): Our results support the hypothesis that the MI is a reliable objective measurement able to distinguish a more homogenous subgroup of insomnia patients characterized by high misperception levels. In this subgroup, misperception seems to extend to wakefulness. On the basis of CET literature, we can speculate that HM patients share a different neurophysiological profile, with greater frontal lobe dysfunction. Although only significant at a single-item level, these patients seem also to show more depressive symptoms. Further research is needed to confirm these results and their reciprocal relationship.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,adult;case report;clinical article;data analysis software;dependent variable;depression;error;female;frontal lobe;human;male;*Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory;multivariate analysis of variance;*primary insomnia;*quantitative analysis;sleep medicine;statistical significance;wakefulness;conference abstract;Personality Assessment;Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders,,,,Quantitative estimation ability and personality assessment in paradoxical and psychophysiological insomnia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Method(s): Twenty-three patients with chronic insomnia were studied for two-night in-home (Sleep ProilerTM, Advanced Brain Monitoring, Carlsbad, CA). From Site-One, nine subjects were studied prior to cognitive behavioral therapy insomnia (CBT-I); two subjects also completed a post-CBT-I study. Of the 14 subjects from Site-Two, ten had comorbid OSA, and eight were studied while on CPAP. The automated sleep staging was manually edited by staff at each study site. In addition to the 30-second awakening based AASM criteria, awakenings were tallied based on consecutive wake epochs from 60-sec to 300-seconds. Sympathetic arousals were based on a six beat-per-minute pulse rate increase compared to the previous 10th beat. From sleep diary responses acquired each night, studies were stratiied into Low-number (< 4 awakenings/ night) and High-number awakenings groups. Result(s): No between-group differences were observed in objectively measured awakenings/hour using any of the objectively-measured awakening durations. There was no association between the self-reported number of awakenings/night vs. any of the objectively-measured awakening durations. Bonferroni-corrected t-test revealed the Highnumber of self-reported awakening group (n = 14 nights) had signiicantly greater number of sympathetic arousals per hour (33.7 +/- 19.7 vs. 13.2 +/- 9.1; p < 0.0001) as compared to the Low-number group (n = 31 nights). For the Low-number awakening group, the bias toward patient under-reporting awakenings was decreased from an average difference of 12-per-night with a 30-second awakening duration, to two-per-night with a 300-second awakening duration. For the High-number awakenings group, the average difference decreased from 8-per-night for a 30-second duration, to zero for a 210-second awakening duration. Conclusion(s): Patients with chronic insomnia do not accurately estimate awakenings as deined by standard 30-second durations. Longer duration awakenings more closely match subjective experience. Increased heart rate variability during sleep appears more prevalent in patients who self-report greater numbers of awakenings/night.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,*sleep;*human;*insomnia;*patient;*organization;*arousal;night;neuromonitoring;pulse rate;self report;cognitive therapy;heart rate variability;Student t test;staging;positive end expiratory pressure;recombinant erythropoietin;Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders,,,,Comparison of objective and subjective measures of awakenings in patients with chronic insomnia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Parental reports of children's sleep are one of the easiest and least expensive methods for estimating sleep timing in children, particularly in large populations, but may or may not yield accurate results. A goal of this study was to validate prospective parental report of weekly child sleep duration versus actigraphy assessed over 1 week. Method(s): Seventy-five children (6-11 years of age) participated in the week-long study. Study procedures involved 1) a parent prospectively completing a 1-page questionnaire of their child's sleeping habits, obtained prior to actigraphy collection, 2) each child wearing an actigraph (Spectrum Respironics/Philips) on the non-dominant wrist for one week, and 3) a parent completing daily sleep diaries about their child during the week of actigraphy collection. We compared parental report of child sleep duration with the actigraphic sleep duration using correlation analysis and mixed model ANOVA. Result(s): The mean+/-SD sleep duration from parental report (10.10h+/-0.70h) and actigraphy (8.95h+/-0.50h were significantly correlated (Pearson r=0.54, p<0.0001) with a mean difference of 1.12+/-0.57h. Parental report of sleep duration was significantly longer than actigraphic sleep duration (p<0.01). Mean diary Time in Bed (10.20+/-0.63) was more closely related to parental report of child sleep (Pearson r=0.60, p<0.0001), with a mean difference of 0.12+/-0.58h. Conclusion(s): Parental report of child sleep duration was significantly and systematically longer than total sleep time using actigraphy. This overestimation by more than an hour appears to be due to parental reports of when children are ""going to bed"" rather than actually sleeping. These findings impact clinical diagnosis in pediatric patients and sleep research investigations where a parental report of child sleep duration is used.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,*sleep;*human;*organization;*child;sleep time;actimetry;diagnosis;parent;sleep disorder;model;patient;procedures;correlation analysis;wrist;habit;questionnaire;population;analysis of variance,,,,Validation of a parental report of child sleep versus direct actigraphic assessment of sleep,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was also reported that individuals have high vulnerability to transient insomnia might have similar personality trait as those with persistent insomnia. It is of interest to see whether this inconsistency is associated with the trait of high sleep vulnerable or more a characteristic of individuals with chronic sleep disturbance. Method(s): 56 subjects were recruited and divided, based on ICSD-3 criteria and their scores on the Ford I nsom nia Response to St ress Test, i nto three groups: a chronic insomnia group (CI; N = 27, mean age = 34.63), a high vulnerability group (HV; N = 15, mean age = 34.53), and a low vulnerability group (LV; N = 14, mean age = 31.71). All participants wore an actigraphy recorder and kept a daily log to rate their subjective sleep quality (5 point represents the best quality) and daytime sleepiness (5 poi nt represe nt s the most sleepine ss) for a week. Obje ctive sleep efficiency (SE), sleep onset latency (SOL), total sleep time(TST), and wake time after sleep onset (WASO) were derived from actigraphic data for analyses. Result(s): The results show no significant dif ference in TST among these three groups, and no significant difference in WASO and SOL between HV and LV. CI reported highest daytime sleepiness and lowest sleep quality, followed by H V. Regression analysis shows that subjective sleep quality (r2 = .127, p = .002) and daytime sleepiness (r2 = .338, p < .001) of HV groups can be predicted by objective WASO and TST, while none of these objective variables can predict subjective sleep quality(r2 = .056, p = .141) and daytime sleepiness (r2 = .039, p = .284) in LV groups. For CI individuals, only TST shows significant but low predictability for their subjective sleep quality (r2 = .045, p = .041) and daytime sleepiness (r2 = .043, p = .048). Conclusion(s): In consistent with previous studies, the present study shows discrepancies between objective evaluation of sleep and subjective evaluation of sleep quality and daytime functioning in insomnia. However, HV individuals demonstrated the highest association between objective sleep measures and subjective ratings, indicating that the discrepancies may be due to the over-concern about sleep in insomnia patients. LV subjects surprisingly showed the lowest association between objective measures and subjective ratings. This may be attributed to a ceiling effect of their subjective ratings with good sleep quality and low daytime sleepiness (Skewness = -.80 and .82, respectively).","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,*sleep;*organization;sleep quality;daytime somnolence;insomnia;human;patient;recorder;regression analysis;actimetry;sleep time;latent period;sleep disorder;personality;nitrogen 15;Sleep,,,,The associations between subjective and objective actigraphic sleep are different for individuals with low and high sleep vulnerability,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Results are mixed, but some children with anxiety also report longer sleep onset latency (SOL). Despite the link between SRPs and mental and physical health consequences, limited research has evaluated the efficacy of brief sleep treatments in this population. Method(s): A mixed methods approach employing a multiple-baseline single-case design and qualitative methods was used to evaluate the efficacy of a four-session parent training intervention in ten children with anxiety and chronic insomnia (M=9.6 years, range 8-12 years, 8 female). Questionnaires on SRPs and anxiety were completed by parents and children at baseline, one-week post-treatment, and onemonth follow-up assessments. Subjective SOL (i.e., sleep diary) and objective SOL (i.e., actigraphy) were measured daily during assessment and treatment weeks. Parents and children completed qualitative interviews at the post-treatment assessment. Result(s): The majority of participants no longer met criteria for chronic insomnia at post-treatment (n=9) or follow-up (n=6). SRPs (e.g., bedtime resistance) were significantly less frequent at post-treatment and follow-up than at baseline. The majority of participants demonstrated significant reductions in subjective (n=7) but not objective (n=3) SOL at post-treatment or follow-up compared to baseline. Qualitatively, parents and children described improvements in sleep during treatment. Some parents described discovering while completing sleep diaries that their child believed themselves to be taking longer to fall asleep at the beginning of treatment than they actually were (i.e., sleep misperception), and that this sleep misperception improved during treatment. Conclusion(s): The findings of the current study support the preliminary efficacy of a brief parent training intervention to treat SRPs in schoolaged children with anxiety. They also begin to help elucidate mixed findings in the literature on sleep of children with anxiety by providing a potential reason for discrepancies between subjective and objective SOL in this population. Specifically, qualitative findings suggest that this discrepancy may be related to sleep misperception, that children with anxiety may feel themselves to be taking a long time to fall asleep even when objective measures of SOL are within the normative range.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,actimetry;*anxiety;bedtime;child;clinical article;comparative effectiveness;conference abstract;controlled study;female;follow up;health;human;*insomnia;interview;qualitative analysis;questionnaire;school child;sleep latency;Only Child;Child;Anxiety,,,,Efficacy of a treatment for sleep-related problems in children with anxiety: A mixed methods study,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, sleep perception might be divers depending on each sleep disorder. The aim of this study was to investigate the differences in sleep perception over patients with chronic primary insomnia(PI) or obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSA) with or without insomnia symptoms. Method(s): We enrolled the consecutive 430 patients(age 20-79) who underwent polysomnography(PSG) and sleep questionnaire including depression scale(BDI) and daytime sleepiness(ESS). We divided into 4 groups: Group I(n, 63) with normal controls, Group II(90) with the patients with PI[apneahypopnea index lower than 5 and DSM-IV criteria], Group III (83) with OSA patients (AHI more than 5 per hr) who have a difficulty of sleep onset and maintenance , and Group IV(194) with OSA patients without subjective insomnia symptoms. We compared the differences of sleep parameters obtained from polysomnography among 4 groups and investigated the discrepancy between objective and subjective total sleep time and sleep latency in each group. Result(s): Sleep perception was defined as the percentage of the ratio between the total sleep time perceived by the patient and the total sleep time obtained by PSG. Mean Sleep perception of 4 groups were 87.4%, 76.6%, 80.9%, and 93.6%, respectively. Group IV showed the highest and group II had the lowest sleep perception. Group III showed definitely lower sleep perception than group IV and were more depressive. Patients who complaint insomnia tended to report longer sleep latency (67.1 min in group II and 70.7 min in III) than others (29.4 min in group I and 29.5 min in IV) subjectively, but the discrepancy ratio (subjective/objective sleep latency) did not reach to statistical significance among groups. Conclusion(s): Patients with insomnia (with or without OSA) appear to underestimate their sleep time as compared with normal controls or patients with OSA. This sleep misperception may be related to higher N2 sleep, WASO, and lower REM sleep (%).","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,"*sleep;*human;*patient;*normal human;*sleep apnea syndrome;insomnia;sleep time;polysomnography;sleep disorder;questionnaire;daytime somnolence;sleep parameters;statistical significance;REM sleep;Sleep Apnea Syndromes;Sleep Apnea, Obstructive",,,,"Sleep perception in chronic primary insomniacs, obstructive sleep apnea syndrome patients, and healthy volunteers",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, sleep efficiency (p=.001) was lower when measured with the actigraph than the sleep log. The number of subjects with insomnia due to low total sleep time was higher when measured with the sleep log than with the actigraph (p< .001). However, sleep satisfactionwas better correlated with data obtained from the sleep log than the actigraph. Conclusion(s):We found discrepancies in the subjective and objective sleep measurements. Older adults appears to report less sleep time than their actual sleep, resulting in higher incidence of insomnia in subjective measurements. Considering the fact that sleep satisfaction was better correlated with sleep log, subjective and objective measurements appear to be equally important in evaluating sleep disturbances in community dwelling older adults.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,aged;female;human;incidence;insomnia;major clinical study;male;satisfaction;sleep latency;*sleep quality;sleep time;wakefulness;welfare;conference abstract,,,,Are there any differences in subjective and objective sleep measurement?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As these use different information to assess sleep, information gaps suggested by discrepancies between estimates may be filled in through cross-referencing of measures for an overall more accurate sleep measurement. We evaluated the utility of using multiple data sources for sleep detection during the COVID-19 lockdown, when normal social cues and routines were disrupted and gave rise to greater variation in sleep patterns. Method(s): 198 staff and students from the National University of Singapore (61 male, mean age 26.15 +/- 5.83 years) were recruited for an 8-week study. Data from the first 5 weeks are reported here. Sleep timings were assessed daily from three channels: a wearable sleep and activity tracker (Oura ring), estimations from smartphone touchscreen interactions (tappigraphy) and smartphone derived EMA self-reports. Result(s): Completion rates for wearable, tappigraphy, and self-report data collection were 90.8%, 88.4% and 87.8% respectively. Across participants, a minimum of two sleep measures were recorded on 94.4% of 5117 potential nights (73.8% with all three measures). Pairwise correlations between each measure with the mean of the other two measures revealed values of R >= 0.71, p < 0.001 for bedtime, and R >= 0.69, p < 0.001 for wake time. T-tests revealed that relative to self-reports, Oura-derived bed and wake times tended to be later (M = 9.90mins, SD = 43.27mins and M = 17.6mins, SD = 54.56mins respectively), and tappigraphy-based bedtimes (but not wake time) were earlier (M = 9.79mins, SD = 86.77mins). Sleep estimates across the three methods showed high overall agreement, with some discrepancies: Relative to matched self-report data, Oura tended to give a later wake time readout while tappigraphy estimates of bedtime tended to be early. Conclusion(s): We show here that the combined use of three streams of data concerning sleep can provide redundancy that covers for lapses in reporting, a problem that plagues longitudinal time series data collection. With continued data acquisition, adjustment through triangulation and resolution of discrepancies across measures may also be used to improve the accuracy of such sleep assessment affording more accurate correlation between sleep and health variables of interest.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,activity tracker;adult;conference abstract;controlled study;coronavirus disease 2019;human;male;night;plague;self report;*sensor;Singapore;*sleep pattern;*smartphone;time series analysis,,,,Evaluating a multi-sensor approach for assessing sleep using wearable and smartphone technology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Method(s): Twenty-seven children (Mage=3.3 years, SD = 1.2 years; 59.3% girls; 85.2% Black; 100% family income <125% of the US poverty level) were asked to wear an actigraph for 14 days while mothers completed telephone-based sleep diaries. Bedtime, wake time, nighttime sleep duration, nap duration, and 24-hour sleep duration were collected by both measures. Paired t-tests examined actigraphic versus mother-reported child sleep. Result(s): Twenty-six percent of dyads (n=7) were excluded due to insufficient data (1-hour difference between measures on >50% of nights). There were no significant demographic differences between dyads with and without discrepant data. Diary-derived sleep onset was calculated by adding caregiver-reported bedtime and caregiverreported sleep onset latency. There was no significant difference between actigraphy-derived sleep onset (M=10:20PM, SD=69min) and diary-derived sleep onset (M=9:59PM, SD=51min). Average actigraphy sleep offset (M=7:27 AM, SD=62 min) was 42 minutes earlier than diary-derived wake time (M=8:09 AM, SD=84 min), p<.05. Actigraphy-estimated nighttime (M=8.38 hours, SD=.80) and 24-hour sleep duration (M=9.31 hours, SD=1.13) were 0.92 and 0.85 hours shorter, respectively, than diary-derived nighttime (M=9.30 hours, SD=1.07) and total sleep duration (M=10.16 hours, SD=1.17), p<.005. There were no significant differences in average nap duration. The primary mother-reported barrier in completing diaries was limited awareness of child sleep due to work schedules. Conclusion(s): Study results highlight some of the challenges of collecting and scoring actigraphy and diary data in preschoolers of lower-income backgrounds, in particular missing diary data and discrepancies between actigraphy and diaries. These findings suggest a need to incorporate both subjective parental report and objective measurement of child sleep in clinical and research contexts, as well determine ways to enhance feasibility and scoring procedures.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,actigraph;awareness;bedtime;caregiver;case report;child;*childhood;clinical article;conference abstract;demography;family income;feasibility study;female;*health disparity;human;infant;mother;night;poverty;*sleep latency;sleep time;telephone;work schedule;Sleep,,,,Objective vs. subjective sleep data in early childhood: Implications for health disparities research,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Clemente, Hospital Center of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal","Objectives: The present study aims to investigate the distribution, consistency, and correlates of sleep time perception in primary insomnia patients. Specifically, this study examines and compares sleep onset latency (SOL), wake time after sleep onset (WASO), total sleep time (TST), sleep efficiency (SE) and objective sleep time estimated (OSE), by comparing the two most important assessment methods in insomnia, actigraphy (A) and sleep logs (SL). Method(s): A total of thirty-two chronic insomnia patients, followed in clinical context, composed our sample (22 males, 10 females, mean age of 49.9 +/- 13.4 years). Each patient underwent seven nights of home actigraphy and provided concurrent subjective estimates of their sleep. Minute-to-minute comparison of actigraphy and sleep log data was made. Other psychological and clinical variables were obtained. Descriptive statistics and inferential tests were used to examine the nature of sleep time perception and its correlates. Result(s): Consistent with the majority of previous studies, our group of insomnia patients overestimate their sleep onset latency (SOL-SL Mean = 28.167; SD = 21.467 versus SOL-A Mean = 11.135; SD = 7.946; P = 0.000). On the other hand, they underestimate their wake time after sleep onset, significantly, on 4th night (WASO-SL Mean = 50.400; SD = 64.012 versus WASO-A Mean = 86.281; SD = 73.027; P < 0.005). They also underestimate their total sleep time (TST-SL Mean = 320.851; SD = 122.234 versus TST-A Mean = 436.135; SD = 72.790; P = 0.000), and sleep efficiency (SE-SL Mean = 62.728; SD = 24.816 versus SE-A Mean = 82.221; SD = 7.402; P = 0.000). In a similar way, insomnia patients' objective sleep estimated score distributions show a greater propensity to underestimate their sleep time (OSE Mean = -23.798%; SD = 31.250%). We also found that sleep time perception doesn't vary with insomnia severity (P = 0.349), depressed symptoms (P = 0.865), diurnal somnolence (P = 0.846) and sleep medication (P = 0.270). Conclusion(s): Subjective perception is of central importance to sleep assessment in primary insomnia. Actigraphy provides only a partial portrayal of the nature of sleep difficulties.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,*sleep;*society;*insomnia;sleep time;human;patient;actimetry;time perception;latent period;night;male;drug therapy;somnolence;statistics;female;Sleep;Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders,,,,Comparison between subjective and actigraphic measurement of sleep in primary insomnia: the accuracy of sleep perception,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Prior research examining objective and subjective measures of hypersomnolence in patients with mood disorders has been inconsistent. The goal of this study was to assess sleep duration and quality among individuals with MDD and comorbid hypersomnia compared to healthy controls. Method(s): Nineteen unmedicated patients with unipolar MDD and hypersomnia and nineteen age- and sex-matched controls were recruited as part of a larger study on EEG biomarkers of hypersomnia in neuropsychiatric disorders. After initial screening, participants completed daily sleep logs and were monitored with wrist-worn actigraphy for a minimum of 1 week prior to ad libitum in-laboratory polysomnography (PSG). Sleep diary, actigraphy, and PSG data were compared between groups, and differences in total sleep time (TST) between sleep logs and actigraphy were compared using Bland-Altman analysis. Result(s): Hypersomnolent MDD participants demonstrated increased TST compared to matched controls using sleep logs (8.37 +/- 0.72 vs. 7.71 +/- 0.71 hrs, p = 0.008), actigraphy (7.35 +/- 0.63 vs. 6.85 +/- 0.53 hrs, p = 0.015), and PSG (9.01 +/- 1.63 vs. 7.45 +/- 1.05 hrs, p = 0.001). All measures also demonstrated significantly increased time in bed in hypersomnolent MDD participants. Among sleep continuity variables, sleep onset latency was greater and sleep efficiency lower among hypersomnolent MDD subjects only when assessed using sleep diaries. Sleep staging using PSG differed between groups for Nl and N2, but not N3 or REM sleep. Bland-Altman analysis demonstrated both groups similarly overestimated subjective sleep time relative to actigraphy (mean difference -0.9 hours for both groups). Conclusion(s): Our results demonstrate MDD patients with comorbid hypersomnolence demonstrate subjective and objective increases in sleep duration relative to healthy sleepers both in the natural environment and during unrestricted sleep in the laboratory setting. Further research is indicated to determine the cause of increased sleep duration in this patient population.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,"*sleep;*sleep time;*major depression;*organization;human;actimetry;hypersomnia;patient;laboratory;diseases;population;functional disease;environment;REM sleep;screening;staging;latent period;polysomnography;wrist;mood disorder;electroencephalogram;biological marker;Comorbidity;Depressive Disorder;Depressive Disorder, Major;Disorders of Excessive Somnolence",,,,Subjective and objective measures of sleep duration and quality in major depressive disorder with comorbid hypersomnolence,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies on polysomnographically-confirmed insomnia complaints in the elderly are scarce. Aim(s): To evaluate whether obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with sleep misperception in elderly insomnia patients. Method(s): Records of patients aged 65 years or older who underwent a full-night sleep study to investigate insomnia symptoms were analyzed. Those with sleep efficiency>=85% were considered as sleep misperception cases and with sleep efficiency<85% were considered confirmed insomnia cases. All answered a psychiatric symptom checklist (SCL-90-R) and the Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS). Result(s): Among 177 insomnia cases, 32 (18%) were classified as sleep misperception. The sleep misperception group was similar to the confirmed insomnia group in terms of anthropometry; no significant difference was found between groups in difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep, sleep quality, scores of the SCL-90-R, and ESS. The whole sample had mean apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of 18+/-18 and 75 patients (42%) had AHI>15. The sleep misperception group had an AHI higher than the confirmed insomnia group (25+/-22 vs. 16+/-16, respectively; P=0.04). In binary logistic regression, controlling for sex, obesity, and ESS>10, the only significant regressor for sleep misperception is AHI>15 (odds ratio, OR=2.89, 95% confidence interval 1.26-6.65; P=0.01).

However, studies attempting to link objectively-recorded hot lashes and sleep quality have produced inconsistent results. We therefore aimed to investigate what proportion of wake time, assessed with polysomnography (PSG), is attributed to the presence of objective nocturnal hot lashes. Method(s): 31 perimenopausal women (age: 50.6 y (SD 2.6)) underwent 1-5 laboratory-based PSG recordings, from which 184 hot lashes were identiied, based on a sharp rise in skin conductance. Women had between 1-9 hot lashes per night. The number of minutes of wakefulness immediately following a hot lash was calculated and summed for each night. Impact of objectively identiied hot lashes on PSG sleep and the relationship between objective and subjective measures of hot lashes were analyzed with hierarchical mixed-effect models. Result(s): Based on PSG, the sample had 84.4% sleep eficiency (95%CI: 82.3-86.6), 58.2 min of wake after sleep onset (95%CI: 48.9-67.5) and 25.5 awakenings (95%CI: 21.8-28.6). Women had 3.4 (95%CI: 2.7-4.1) objective hot lashes per night. There were, on average, 16.7 min (95%CI: 10.5-22.9) of wakefulness due to hot lashes per night, with a high night-to-night variability within women. While subjective and objective measures were positively correlated for numbers of awakenings (p < .001), hot lashes (p = .027) and wake after sleep onset (p < .001), individuals underestimated number of awakenings and overestimated wake after sleep onset and number of hot lashes. Number of objective hot lashes signiicantly predicted the amount of PSG time awake due to hot lashes per night (p = .041) and self-reported severity of hot lashes (p = .009). Between-subject variance in number of nights and time in bed was small. Conclusion(s): Approximately 30% of the total wake time after sleep onset can be attributed to objectively-recorded hot lashes in these perimenopausal women.

The purpose of this paper is to describe and evaluate relationships between subjective and objective measures of sleep. Method(s): Participants were referred from the Philadelphia and Buffalo VA Medical Centers and asked to participate following one cycle of platinum- based chemotherapy. Participants completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and wore the motionlogger actigraph (Ambulatory Monitoring, Inc.) on their nondominant wrist for 3-7 days. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used. Result(s): Among 50 participants, mean age was 64.2 years (sd = 9.9, Range = 47-84), with 98% male, and 50% African American. The majority of patients were diagnosed with Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (73.6%). Mean PSQI results revealed: sleep latency 36 (sd = 32), sleep duration 5.9 (sd = 1.8) hours, and sleep efficiency 77% (sd = 19). Mean motionlogger actigraphy results revealed sleep latency 76 (sd = 83), sleep duration 5.2 (sd = 2.1), and sleep efficiency 67% (sd = 16). Mean global sleep quality was 9.0 (sd = 4.0) with 77% of the sample scoring above the clinically significant cutoff score of five.

Sleep misperception is common among many different populations including adolescents. Additionally, self report of blood glucose in adults with both Type I diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) and Type II diabetes were shown to be unreliable when compared to objective blood glucose measures. The present study investigated whether school-aged children with T1DM were accurate in their subjective reporting of sleep duration on weekdays versus weekends when compared to an objective measure of sleep. Method(s): Thirty-two children (mean age:13.12 years; range:10-16 years; 45.5% females; 66.7% Hispanic or mixed race) with T1DM recruited for a larger study examining the role of sleep in glucose control and daytime functioning for youth with diabetes were assessed for congruency between sleep diaries and actigraphy data. Participants completed both measures concurrently over 5 days. Zero-order correlational analyses were conducted to assess the relations between subjective and objective measures of total sleep time. Result(s): Participants' mean hemoglobin A1c was 9.44(SD = 2.20). In school-aged children with T1DM subjective versus objective measures produced signiicant correlations for total sleep time on both weekdays (r = .86, p <.001) and weekends (r = .52, p =.002).

These analyses compare the accuracy of SAFTE-FAST AutoSleep predictions against pilots' sleep diary and actigraphy from Azul's COVID-19 humanitarian missions. Method(s): Pilots wore a sleep-tracking actigraphy device (Zulu Watch, Institutes for Behavior Resources), and reported the TIB and sleep quality of their in-flight rest periods using a sleep diary. Diary TST was estimated from TIB and sleep quality. AutoSleep, diary, and actigraphy measures were compared using paired samples t-tests. Agreement was compared using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). Result(s): Twenty (n=20) pilots flying across 5 humanitarian missions provided sleep diary and actigraphy data. AutoSleep predictions of TIB (235+/-20 minutes) and TST (193+/-16 minutes) were significantly lower than diary (TIB: 330+/-123, t=6.80, p<=0.001; TST: 262+/-108, t=5.60, p<=0.001) and comparable to actigraphy (TIB: 246+/-127, t=0.78, p=0.43; TST: 212+/-113, t=1.59, p=0.12). ICC values were >0.90, indicating excellent agreement, for TIB (0.94) and TST (0.91). Conclusion(s): Biomathematical predictions of in-flight sleep during unprecedented humanitarian missions were in agreement with actual sleep patterns during flights. These findings indicate that biomathematical models may retain accuracy even under extreme circumstances like the COVID-19 pandemic. Pilots may overestimate the amount of sleep that they receive during extreme flights-duty periods, which could constitute a fatigue risk.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,actigraph;avoidance behavior;*Brazil;*China;clinical article;conference abstract;controlled study;*coronavirus disease 2019;correlation coefficient;fatigue;flying;human;pandemic;*prediction;*sleep pattern;sleep quality;sleep time;time in bed;wrist;China;Brazil,,,,Pilot sleep during Brazil-to-China COVID-19 humanitarian mission flights compared to biomathematical predictions of sleep,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dietch, University of North Texas, Denton, TX, United States","Introduction: Single time-point retrospective questionnaires of sleep, or sleep surveys, are subjective measures that briefly assess various sleep parameters typically using 1-3 questions. Surveys are the most frequently used measures of sleep in existing research yet validity research is extremely limited. The current study sought to compare survey measures of total sleep time (TST), sleep efficiency (SE), and circadian midpoint (CM) with prospective subjective (i.e., sleep diary) and objective (i.e., actigraphy, EEG) measures. Method(s): Community adults (N = 80; M age = 32.7+/-10.1; 63% female; 85% white) completed psychosocial baseline questionnaires. Over the next 7 days and nights, they completed a sleep diary and wore an actigraph and a single-channel EEG device in their typical sleeping environment. Participants then completed a retrospective survey of their sleep over the past 7 days and a clinical interview for sleep disorders. Sleep parameters were compared using Bland- Altman plots and prediction intervals. Result(s): Bland-Altman plots revealed non-constant bias such that individuals with lower TST, SE, and CM underestimated these parameters on survey and individuals with greater TST, SE and CM overestimated on survey compared to sleep diary, actigraphy, and EEG. Prediction intervals were broad for survey compared to other measures: over 1.3 hours for TST, over 10% for SE, and over 45 minutes for CM, suggesting that precision of estimates from surveys was poor. Conclusion(s): Results suggest retrospective sleep surveys demonstrated poor validity compared to other subjective and objective measures. Most concerning is the non-constant bias at different levels of TST, SE, and CM which is difficult to adjust for either clinically or statistically. Previous research suggests recall for frequent behaviors such as sleep is poor and subject to high degrees of error/reporting bias, particularly in individuals with insomnia. If attempting to approximate objective measures and limit bias, sleep diaries are the subjective measure of choice. Future research should differentiate between subjective and objective estimates of sleep parameters as related yet overlapping constructs.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,actigraph;adult;controlled study;electroencephalogram;female;human;insomnia;interview;major clinical study;male;night;prediction;questionnaire;recall;reporting bias;retrospective study;sleep quality;*sleep time;*validity;conference abstract,,,,"Validity of survey measures of sleep duration, efficiency, and timing",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the relationship between napping and nighttime sleep quality can be confounded by negative response bias (i.e., self-reports may be contaminated by psychological status). Here, we examined the relationship between frequency of napping and nighttime sleep quality using both self-reports and an objective measure of sleep: actigraphy. Method(s): 436 undergraduates (age = 19.88 +/- 1.50 years, 50% female) took a napping survey and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI; Buysse et al., 1989). A subsample of 97 participants wore an actigraph for up to one week after the survey. We used Pearson correlation coeficients to analyze associations between nap frequency and nighttime sleep quality using self-reports and actigraphy. Result(s): Self-reports revealed that people who nap more frequently have signiicantly worse subjective sleep quality, r = .20, p < .0001. When analyzing subdomains of the PSQI, napping was associated with worse sleep quality (r = .20, p < .0001), shorter sleep duration (r = .17, p = .0004), worse sleep eficiency (r = .11, p = .027), and increased daytime dysfunction (r = .19, p < .0001). However, for the objective indicators of nighttime sleep quality, napping was not associated with actigraphy measures of sleep latency (r = .12, p = .26), sleep eficiency (r = -.06, p = .55), wake after sleep onset (r = .10, p = .35), and total sleep time (r = -.13, p = .19). Conclusion(s): Napping and nighttime sleep quality are associated using subjective, but not objective, reports of sleep quality. Associations between napping and sleep quality may therefore be confounded by response bias. For example, individuals with high levels of depression or stress may nap more frequently and overestimate or overreport sleep disturbance.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,*sleep;*sleep quality;*self report;*actimetry;*organization;human;sleep time;Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index;female;sleep disorder;hay,,,,The association between napping and nighttime sleep quality using self-reports and actigraphy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To assist with participant screening in interventions accurate self-report instruments assessing multiple lifestyle behaviours are needed. The purpose of this study was to compare the accuracy of a self-report instrument assessing sleep, physical activity, sitting and diet over the previous week to criterion measures of these behaviours. Method(s): Participants (n = 27) wore 3 activity monitors for 5 days: (1) an Actigraph GT3x on their non-dominant wrist, (2) an Actigraph GT3x on their waist, (3) an activPAL3c on their thigh. The wrist worn Actigraph and activPAL3c were worn day and night. Participants also kept a food diary over this time period. At the end of this period participants completed an online survey assessing the number of days in the last week they had good quality sleep, did at least 30 min of moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity (MVPA), sat for less than 8 h, consumed 2 serves of fruit and 5 serves of vegetables, and consumed takeaway foods (e.g., fast food). Sleep quality was assessed using the Sadeh algorithm, and MVPA bouts in non-sleep periods was assessed using the cut-point of >1951 counts min-1. Sitting time during non-sleep periods was assessed by summing sitting times provided by the activPAL3c. Food diaries were examined to identify the number of days that participants consumed 2 serves of fruit and 5 serves of vegetables, and takeaway foods. Spearman's Rho and Bland Altman plots were used to assess correlations and agreement between self-report and criterion measures of each behaviour. Result(s): Correlations between self-report and criterion measures of sleep quality (rho = 0.35), sitting (rho = 0.38), and fruit and vegetable consumption (rho = 0.25) were not statistically significant (all p values > 0.05). Correlations between self-report and criterion measures of takeaway food (rho = 0.53, p = 0.006) and MVPA (rho = 0.39, p = 0.043), were statistically significant. Bland Altman plots showed a tendency for participants to report higher sleep quality compared to the criterion measure. Discussion(s): Observed correlations varied across behaviours. Some correlations were comparable to those typically reported in the literature (e.g. 0.40-0.57 for MVPA) whereas others were lower (e.g. 0.45 for fruit and vegetable). Further refinement of a convenient and accurate instrument to assess multiple lifestyle behaviours is warranted.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,*screening;*lifestyle;*sports medicine;*Australia;human;sleep;self report;food;sitting;vegetable;fruit;sleep quality;physical activity;wrist;algorithm;monitor;fast food;statistical significance;night;thigh;diet;Life Style,,,,Accuracy of a brief screening tool for multiple lifestyle behaviours,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies have demonstrated the eficacy of Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBTi) in older adults, yet change in the subjective/ objective discrepancy is rarely investigated. This study examined the impact and durability of CBTi on reducing sleep discrepancy in older adults, and tested whether changes in sleep quality were related to reductions in sleep discrepancy. Method(s): 159 older veterans (97% male, mean age 72.2 years) who met diagnostic criteria for insomnia of > 3 months duration were randomized to: 1) individual CBTi (iCBTi), 2) group CBTi (gCBTi), or 3) attention control. Assessments were conducted at baseline, post-treatment, 6-months, and 12-months follow-up. Sleep measures included: 1) sleep diary TST; 2) actigraphy TST; and 3) Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score. TST discrepancy was computed by subtracting actigraphy TST from sleep diary TST. Minutes of TST discrepancy in each intervention group were compared to controls using ANCOVA. A crosslagged panel model was it to the data to examine whether PSQI score was related to subsequent changes in sleep discrepancy. Result(s): Compared to controls, participants randomized to iCBTi or gCBTi became more accurate in their perceptions of sleep at posttreatment (p's < .05). Improvements persisted at 6-month (iCBTi =-1.8 minutes; gCBTi =-0.1 minutes; controls =-34.1 minutes; p's < .05) and 12-month follow-up (gCBTi = 7.3 minutes; controls =-25.7 minutes; p's < .05). Improvements in PSQI total scores at each study assessment predicted reduced sleep discrepancy at the next study assessment (e.g., lower 6-month PSQI predicted less discrepancy at 12-months, all paths p < .05). Conclusion(s): CBTi reduces sleep discrepancy among older adults with insomnia. The reductions in sleep discrepancy were driven by prior improvements in sleep quality. Improving sleep quality appears to be a viable path to improving sleep perception and may explain the underlying effectiveness of CBTi.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,*sleep;*adult;*sleep quality;*insomnia;*organization;*cognitive therapy;human;Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index;follow up;actimetry;sleep time;male;model;diagnosis;veteran;patient;analysis of covariance;Cognitive Therapy;Behavior Therapy;Cognition;Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders,,,,Cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia in older adults: Improving sleep quality reduces sleep discrepancy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is unknown if these individuals would be similarly classified based upon habitual sleep duration, as measured by sleep diaries or wrist actigraphy. Moreover, the stability of the ISS classification across multiple PSG nights is unknown. Our aim was to evaluate the agreement of ISS classification based on one laboratory-based PSG night compared to habitual diary- and actigraphy- assessed habitual sleep among adults diagnosed with insomnia. Our secondary aim was to examine whether ISS classification differed across multiple nights of PSG data. Method(s): 217 participants (58% female, 63.2 +/- 15.1 y) who met diagnostic criteria for insomnia were included in analyses. All had at least one PSG night, with 7-14 nights of diary and/or actigraphy data. A subset of the sample had second (n=170) and third (n=72) nights of PSG data. The ISS phenotype was classified using the criterion < 6 h of total sleep time (TST). Using this criterion and using the first PSG night as the referent classification, we calculated Cohen's Kappa statistic and percentage agreement between different methods of ISS classification. Result(s): 58% of the sample was classified as the ISS phenotype based upon one night of PSG TST. There was 65% agreement in ISS phenotype classification between PSG and diary TST (kappa=.28) and 57% agreement between PSG and actigraphy TST (kappa=.22). There was 39% agreement in ISS phenotype classification between the first and second night of PSG TST (kappa=.23) and 66% agreement between the first and third night of PSG for TST (kappa=.31). All Kappa values indicated poor (<.20) to fair (0.21-0.40) agreement between different ISS classifications. Conclusion(s): These results indicate low agreement between one PSG night and other methods of sleep assessment to classify the ISS phenotype, and low reliability of classification across PSG nights. This implies that the ISS phenotype may not reflect an individual's habitual sleep or a persistent or trait-like characteristic. Future research is needed to address this potential issue in methods of measurement for the ISS phenotype.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,"actimetry;adult;classification;diagnosis;female;human;*insomnia;intermethod comparison;kappa statistics;major clinical study;male;*night;*phenotype;polysomnography;reliability;*sleep time;Sleep Disorders;Phenotype;Habituation, Psychophysiologic;Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders;Sleep",,,,The insomnia short-sleep phenotype: Does one night of laboratory sleep accurately capture their habitual sleep?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Regarding the relevance of variability of SWC, two examples will be presented, the first one about the use of variability of parameters to discriminate patients from controls and the second to further explore the sources of discrepancies between objective (actigraphy) and subjective (questionnaires) measures. We will also show that network analyses of commonly used actigraphy parameters may provide a more comprehensive view of how parameters covariate together or desynchronize in certain conditions.

Poor and disrupted sleep may lead to other negative health outcomes, such as poor QOL and elevated depressive symptoms, highlighting the importance of assessing sleep in caregivers and children with CF. However, few studies have examined sleep and feasibility of measures using the dyad of both caregiver and child. Method(s): Caregivers were over the age of 18, and children had to be between the ages of 8 and 13 years, with a documented diagnosis of cystic fibrosis. 10 dyads were recruited (mean age of caregiver = 38.4 +/- 3.4 years; 80% high school grads; 8 female; mean age of child = 8.9 +/- 2.5 years, 6 females, all Caucasian). Caregivers completed the PSQI, CES-D depression measure, PROMTS Sleep Disturbance (SF-6), and World Health Organization Quality-of-Life-BREF measure. Children filled out the Pediatric Daytime Sleepiness Scale (PDSS). Both caregiver and child wore an actigraph for a week and kept a sleep diary. Result(s): Caregivers slept a mean of 6 hours and 33 minutes, but reported a mean of 7 hours on the PSQI, with a PSQI score of 6.56, PRO-MIS mean of 8.5. Children slept a mean of 7 hours and 45 minutes. Caregivers reported elevated levels of depressive symptoms (CESD mean 9.4 +/- 7.2), and lowered physical QOL (mean 26.7 +/- 4.8). Children reported a mean of 14.6 +/- 4.7 on the PDSS. Conclusion(s): Caregivers are reporting short sleep and poor quality of sleep, but may be overestimating the number of hours they actually get when compared to actigraphy. Children with CF are not getting adequate sleep as reported by actigraphy. Poor sleep may have further implications for children and caregivers on overall health, including depressive symptoms and QOL.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,*sleep;*human;*child;*chronic disease;*organization;*caregiver;depression;cystic fibrosis;female;actimetry;health;Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index;daytime somnolence;sleep quality;World Health Organization;sleep disorder;Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale;Caucasian;quality of life;high school;diagnosis;Only Child;Chronic Disease;Child;Sleep,,,,Sleep in caregivers and children with a chronic illness,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sleep quality in FM patients is commonly assessed through self-reports (SR), however studies with actigraphy (AG) gave unclear results (Diaz-Piedra et al. 2015) and found that the agreements between AG and SR sleep latencies and Total Sleep Time (TST) were poor, with high discrepancies associated to high FM impact scores (Segura-Jimenez et al. 2015). We compared the SR and AG sleep quality measures of FM patients with those of age-matched healthy controls (HC); and examined the concordance between subjective and objective (AG) measures of sleep in both groups. Method(s): Patients were recruited at the FM unit of the university hospital. After a medical visit, physicians invited female outpatients who fulfilled both ACR/EULAR 1990 and 2010 diagnostic criteria to participate in the study. HC were enrolled in the Sapienza university community. All participants wore a wrist actigraph (AMI Motionlogger Watch) and completed a sleep diary for seven consecutive days. When returning the actigraph, they completed questionnaires measuring sleep quality (Sleep Disorder Questionnaire), fatigue severity (Checklist Individual Strength), and fibromyalgia impact (FIQ). Result(s): 30 FM patients and 23 HC were included for data analysis. The sleep questionnaire showed poorer sleep quality in several variables considered in FM patients compared to HC (all p < 0.001). FM patients and HC did not differ in any of the actigraphy measures of sleep efficiency or continuity (e.g. Sleep Efficiency p = 0.40, WASO p = 0.45, Sleep Fragmentation Index p = 0.75). The intermethod agreement for TST and Sleep Efficiency was low in FM patients, while it was good for TST among HC. Hierarchical regressions considering fatigue severity and sleep measures showed that fatigue gave a unique significant contribution to the FM impact. Conclusion(s): Although FM patients and HC have similar objective AG sleep patterns, the subjective experience of sleep quantity and quality is poorer among FM patients, suggesting that they might underestimate TST. These findings support the view that fatigue is a crucial feature and the importance of assessing both objective and subjective measures of sleep quality in FM patients.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,actigraph;adult;checklist;clinical article;controlled study;data analysis;disease course;fatigue;female;*fibromyalgia;human;intermethod comparison;outpatient;physician;questionnaire;self report;sleep disorder;sleep pattern;*sleep quality;sleep time;university hospital;wrist;conference abstract;Fibromyalgia,,,,Self-reported and actigraphic sleep quality in female patients with fibromyalgia and healthy controls,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we report the results of 4 studies aimed at exploring the joint effects of chronic insomnia and objective sleep duration on neuropsychological functioning, long-term development of depression, personality, and sleep misperception in a general population random sample of 1741 individuals (Penn State Sleep Cohort). Method(s): ""Insomnia"" was defined as a complaint of insomnia with a duration of > 1 year and the absence of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). We classified polysomnographic (PSG) sleep duration into two categories: > 6 h of sleep and < 6 h of sleep. We controlled for age, race, gender, education, BMI, mental, and physical health problems in all multivariate ANOVA and regression analyses. Result(s): Compared to controls, the insomnia with < 6 hour sleep duration group showed deficits in tasks of processing speed, short-term memory, and switching attention, and a higher risk to develop depression at 5 years follow-up, which was independent of their personality profile. In contrast, the insomnia with > 6 hour sleep duration group did not show significant neurocognitive deficits and their risk of developing depression was mediated by their anxious ruminative psychological profile; however, this group significantly complained of non-restorative sleep and presented a gross underestimation of sleep time. Conclusion(s): Insomnia with objective normal sleep duration is related to sleep misperception, non-restorative sleep, and anxious-ruminative traits. Insomnia with objective short sleep duration is associated with a psychological profile typical of medical outpatients, which does not explain their higher risk for developing depression; also, this group presents deficits in the ""executive control of attention"", a higher cognitive function that involves the prefrontal cortex. Thus, objective sleep duration in chronic insomnia may be a reliable index of the biological severity of the disorder.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,*sleep;*insomnia;*society;risk;personality;education;health;regression analysis;processing;velocity;short term memory;follow up;sleep time;outpatient;manager;cognition;hyperactivity;hypothalamus hypophysis adrenal system;morbidity;analysis of variance;hypertension;population;random sample;sleep disordered breathing;gender;prefrontal cortex;Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders,,,,Switching attention to insomnia: The role of objective sleep duration,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pain index are more intense than in Rheumatoid Arthritis patients but supportive objective data are lacking. Sleep is among the most prevalent complaints and the intrusion of alpha activity, although common, is not specific. It may be considered that, somehow, the peripheral dysfunctions or complaints are magnified centrally. Therefore the objectives are: 1) To compare sleep and sleep questionnaires in FMP and healthy controls (HC); 2) To identify dissociated states (DS) in sleep microstructure,i.e., occurrence of alpha delta, NREM microevents in REM, presence of REMs and myoclonia in NREM. Material(s) and Method(s): 20 FMP, mean age 44.00, and 14 HC, mean age 43.21, all females were evaluated with the following instruments: Type 1 PSG with 19 EEG electrodes, PSQI and Epworth Sleepiness scale (ESS). PSG were visually staged by experienced technicians and dissociated states were scored by a single technician. The percentage of DS (taking as reference the total number of sleep epochs per subject) was computed together with current sleep parameters. Student T test was used to evaluate differences between groups and Pearson correlation analysis was done to evaluated correlations between individual measures. Result(s): Significant differences between groups are: Body Mass Index (FMP = 25.68; HC = 22.58); PSQI (FMP = 11.8; HC = 5.23); %N1 (FMP = 13.0; HC = 6.3); Microarousals (FMP = 37.8; HC = 40.4); Periodic Limb Movements of Sleep (PLMS) (FMP = 2.8; HC=.73); Alpha delta (AD) (FMP = 21.0; HC = 7.9); NREM myoclonia (FMP=.02; HC = 0.0); absence of DS (FMP = 76.8; HC = 90.6). Correlation analysis provided the following results: A- Sleep parameters: Total Sleep Time (TST) correlated with Time in bed (TIB), Sleep efficiency (SE), %N2, and negatively with %N3. SE correlates negatively with Sleep Latency (SL), REM latency (RL), %N1, Awakenings SL correlates with TIB, RL, %N1 RL correlates with TIB, Awakenings, PLMS, PSQI and negatively with %R %N1 correlates with Awakenings, PLMS, PSQI and negatively with %N3, % R %N2 correlates negatively with %N3, % R, ESS %N3 correlates with Awakenings, PSQI, ESS %R correlates negatively with Awakenings Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI) correlates with age PLMS correlates with PSQI ESS correlates with %N3 and negatively with %N2 B- DS parameters: AD correlates with Awakenings, %N2, Alpha REM (AR), REMs in NREM, REM without atonia and negatively with %R, ESS, absence of DS AR correlates with K-complex in REM and negatively with absence of DS Spindles in REM correlates with RL, Microarousals and NREM myoclonia REMs in NREM correlates with %N1, Awakenings, REM without atonia and negatively with ESS, absence of DS Microarousals correlates with NREM myoclonia NREM myoclonia correlates with Microarousals, PSQI, ESS REM without atonia correlates with RL, % N2, AD and negatively with %R, absence of DS Absence of DS correlates with %R, ESS and negatively with awakenings 1421. Conclusion(s): Concerning our objectives it must be stated that the differences between groups are not overwhelming; the existent in term of polisomnography are mostly related with sleep microstructure. In fact FMP have decreased Microarousals, higher PLMS index and percentage of DS comparing with HC. FMP have also higher percentage of alpha delta sleep and NREM Myoclonia. In spite of this, and in line with the dissociation hypothesis, the subjective complaints evaluated by the PSQI are higher in FMP. The presence of dissociated states in sleep EEG is a further proof in favor of this hypothesis. The correlations found are in line with the general postulates of sleep organization.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,*sleep;*prevalence;*fibromyalgia;*sleep medicine;*society;arousal;myoclonus;Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index;sleep parameters;correlation analysis;patient;hypothesis;human;rheumatoid arthritis;Epworth sleepiness scale;pain;sleep time;electrode;periodic limb movement disorder;apnea hypopnea index;body mass;questionnaire;alpha rhythm;Student t test;female;latent period;electroencephalogram;parameters;sleep stage;dissociation;recombinant erythropoietin;Prevalence;Fibromyalgia;Heart Block,,,,Dissociated sleep states in fibromyalgia: Prevalence and correlations,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sleep quality, however, has been mainly assessed by the use of self-reported measures, thus limiting clinical usefulness. We review the literature about the sleep quality of workers supported by objective neurophysiological tools, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Material(s) and Method(s): We conducted a systematic search of the PubMed database through October 27, 2021, including terms Covid-19, sleep, workers, neurophysiology, polysomnography and actigraphy. Result(s): A total of 13 studies were included. Out of these, only two studies evaluated sleep problems in workers (Healthcare professionals) with objective neurophysiological tools such as actigraphic evaluation. About 35% of healthcare workers were suffering from sleep disturbances having a sleep efficiency value less than 90% and high PSQI scores with a significant negative correlation between SE and PSQI and a trend of a negative association between SE and age. No other job categories were evaluated. Conclusion(s): During the lockdown, increases in sleep problems are associated with sense of time and are more pronounced in individuals with higher levels of depression, anxiety, and stress. People who isolated at home (smart-working) reported significantly earlier sleep onset and wake-up times than actigraphy-defined, tending to overestimate their specific sleep times. It is of utmost relevance to assess sleep by objective measures to set appropriate preventive strategies treating sleep problems, thus also obtaining reduced psychological distress.Copyright Â© 2021","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,actimetry;adult;anxiety;conference abstract;*coronavirus disease 2019;*depression;*distress syndrome;female;*health care personnel;human;lockdown;male;Medline;mental stress;*neurophysiology;*pandemic;Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index;polysomnography;prevention;sleep disorder;sleep efficiency;sleep time;*stage 1 sleep;systematic review;wake up time;Neurophysiology,,,,Neurophysiology of sleep in workers' health and safety during Covid19 pandemic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The hypothesis that the typical daytime hyperactivity observed in these patients may correspond to an increased motor activity during the night, thus causing sleep disruption, has been studied in children, but rarely in adults. Here we present a first detailed analysis of the nocturnal motor activity in ADHD adults compared to healthy controls, including the time structure of leg movements (LM) during sleep. Method(s): Fifteen ADHD patients and eighteen control subjects underwent four in-lab polysomnographic sleep recordings. The periodic character of LM was evaluated using validated markers of ""periodicity"", i.e. the periodicity index, inter-movement intervals and time distribution of LM during sleep, in addition to standard parameters, such as the periodic leg movement during sleep index (PLMSI) and periodic leg movement during sleep arousal index (PLMSAI). Sleep quality and the prevalence of insomnia symptoms were assessed with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). None of the participants had restless legs syndrome. Result(s): Objective sleep parameters from the baseline night did not differ between ADHD and control subjects, with the exception of a longer sleep latency (p=0.007) in the patient group, as well as a slightly higher PLMSI (p=0.044) and PLMS duration (p=0.023), only in REM sleep. The PSQI questionnaire indicated a poor sleep quality and the ISI the prevalence of subclinical insomnia symptoms in ADHD patients. Conclusion(s): Leg movement activity during sleep in ADHD adult subjects was neither more frequent than in healthy controls nor did the nocturnal motor events show an increased periodicity. The reduced subjective sleep quality reported by ADHD adults was in contrast to the normal objective polysomnographic parameters, suggesting a sleep-state misperception in these individuals or more subtle sleep abnormalities not picked up by the traditional sleep staging.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,adult;arousal;*attention deficit disorder;clinical article;congenital malformation;controlled study;doctor patient relation;*female;human;insomnia;Insomnia Severity Index;*male;motor activity;night;*periodic limb movement disorder;periodicity;Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index;prevalence;questionnaire;*REM sleep;restless legs syndrome;sleep quality;staging;symptom;Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity;Leg,,,,Leg movement activity during sleep in adults with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Method(s): Forty subjects with DS with mild and moderate mental retardation over 18 years participated in a cross-sectional analytical study. Nocturnal sleep was objectively studied by two PSG: adaptation PSG and basal PSG separated within 7 days, and by subjective sleep measures: Pittsburgh questionnaire to evaluate sleep quality, Epworth Scale to evaluate sleepiness and Berlin Questionnaire to identify patients at risk for the sleep apnea. The circadian rhythm of wake/sleep pattern was investigated with sleep diaries and actigraphy in the period between both PSG. Result(s): There is a discrepancy between subjective sleep measures and PSG and actigraphy results. Subjective evaluations did not show any sleep disturbances and did not detect sleep apneas in adults with DS either as shown by the mean values of the different scales (Pittsburg 4.09 +/- 3.41; Epworth 6.24 +/- 4.28; Berlin 1.07 +/- 0.26). Objective measures on the PSG showed, decreases in total sleep time (308.51 +/- 100.82 minutes), in sleep efficiency (63.71 +/- 20.35%) and REM sleep (8.79 +/- 5.61 minutes). The PSG also evidenced respiratory disturbances (apnea/hypopnea index: 24.56 +/- 25.49). Actigraphy data also showed lower sleep efficiency compared to the one reported in the sleep diaries (74.33 +/- 14.11 vs 87.83 +/- 10.64). Conclusion(s): Results confirm presence of an important sleep disruption in adult subjects with DS which is not detected by current subjective sleep measures.

To date there are a limited number of studies that compare subjective and objective measures of sleep in populations of subjects with mood disorders. The current study evaluated the relationship between subjective and objective measurements of sleep variables in a BD I population. Method(s): Thirty-nine BD subjects (type I) participated in this study. YMRS and IDS-30-C assessed the severity of manic and depressive symptoms , respectively. Subjects wore the actigraph device on their non-dominant wrist and maintained a sleep diary for seven consecutive days. Actigraphy data was sampled in 60s epochs. Total sleep time (TST) was calculated via the UCSD sleep algorithm. Differences between subjective and objective measures of sleep were calculated by the objective time measured minus the subjective time reported. Result(s): Objective and subjective measures of TST were signiicantly correlated (r = 0.5151, p = 0.0008). Secondary analysis revealed that the overall mood state impact on discrepancy was p = 0.04. The severity of manic symptoms did not correlate with this discrepancy (t = 0.03, p = 0.98). The severity of depressive symptoms did correlate to this discrepancy (t = 2.65, p = 0.01). Conclusion(s): The results of the current study support the notion that there is consistency in the estimation of total sleep time as measured objectively via actigraphy and subjectively via sleep diaries in BD patients. We did note that mood symptomotology may impact the accuracy of TST reported. Sleep factors are common elements in the description and assessment of BD. The outcome of this study warrants further examination of the reliability of subjective assessment of sleep factors amongst a BD population in a clinical setting and should take mood symptoms into account.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,*sleep;*sleep time;*human;*patient;*organization;population;mood;actimetry;implantable cardioverter defibrillator;depression;wrist;mood disorder;devices;bipolar disorder;reliability;examination;sleep disorder;secondary analysis;algorithm;Young Mania Rating Scale;recombinant erythropoietin,,,,Comparison of objective and subjective assessments of total sleep time in bipolar patients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We explored sleep EEG profiles of insomnia patients to develop neurophysiological subtypes. Material(s) and Method(s): Participants with Insomnia Disorder completed two consecutive overnight polysomnographic studies (PSG) with total bedtime (TBT) reduced by two hours on the second night. SWA (EEG delta power, 0.5 - 4.5 Hz) across all sleep stages on Night 1 and Night 2 PSGs was computed using absolute power spectral analysis and an interhemispheric asymmetry index ((left SWA - right SWA)/(left SWA + right SWA)) was calculated. Principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering of 34 objective sleep parameters from Night 1, including SWA in left and right hemispheres, asymmetry index and sleep architecture were measured to determine EEG-based subtypes (ACTRN 12615000751572). Result(s): EEG data from 99 insomnia patients (46.2 (SD 14.9) y; 69.7% female; insomnia severity index 19.9 (SD 4.0) were evaluated. Cluster analysis revealed three objective EEG subtypes of insomnia based on the top 10 independent components derived from Night 1 (88% variance explained). On Night 1, subtype A (n=26) had low global SWA, poor sleep efficiency (62%), the shortest TST (299.2 min), longest WASO duration (132.5 min), and the highest arousal index in NREM compared to other subtypes (all p< 0.001). Subtype B (n=51) also had low SWA across all sleep stages but good sleep efficiency (80.3 %). Subtype C (n=22) showed higher SWA compared to other two subtypes (p< 0.001) and good sleep efficiency (80.0%). Subtype B showed the worst subjective sleep quality and underestimated sleep based on sleep-state misperception index (objective TST-subjective TST/objective TST; p< 0.05). There were no differences in interhemispheric asymmetry between the subtypes; however, subtype B showed a positive correlation between WASO and asymmetry index during REM (p< 0.05). Sleep restriction (-2h TBT) on Night 2 improved all sleep metrics across all subtypes. There was no change in sleep-state misperception between nights across all subtypes, whilst only subtype B showed improvement in subjective sleep quality on Night 2 (p< 0.05). Conclusion(s): We found evidence of three insomnia subtypes based on SWA and PSG sleep parameter differences. While all subtypes reported similar insomnia symptom severity, there were differences in SWA which may explain sleep-state misperception. Subtypes A and B had low SWA and underestimated total sleep duration, despite differences in sleep quality. Whilst sleep restriction improved objective sleep metrics (sleep efficiency, sleep onset latency, WASO) there was no change in sleep misperception in subtypes A and B. Whereas subtype C reported insomnia symptom severity similar to the other types, they had high SWA and good sleep quality. These findings indicate that sleep misperception in insomnia may result from different neural mechanisms and that hyperarousal may be influenced by lower SWA and explain subjective sleep complaints.

Few data exist regarding the clinical characteristics of adolescents who present for treatment for their DSPD. The objective of the present study was to provide information on the clinical presentation of adolescents with DSPD. Method(s): Data were obtained from 49 adolescents (14.6}1.0 yrs, 53% males) diagnosed with DSPD. Diagnosis was made via a 1-hr clinical sleep history interview with the adolescent and at least one parent, as well as a 7-day sleep diary and simultaneous wrist actigraphy recording. Adolescents also completed sleepiness, fatigue and depression questionnaires. Result(s): 100% of adolescents reported a gradual onset of their sleep problem, occurring at ~10 yrs. 100% reported their schooling was affected by their sleep disorder, with 16% not attending school. All reported insomnia symptoms, including difficulty falling asleep and waking, as well as cognitive arousal in bed (eg, mind racing). Interestingly, adolescents misperceived their sleep onset time by 14 min, however this difference was driven by gender with females misperceiving more than males. Once asleep though, no misperception of sleep time occurred. In terms of sleep hygiene, 89% possessed electronic media in their bedroom (eg, cell phone), 35% consumed caffeine in the afternoon, 33% took frequent longs naps, and 14% used social substances (ie, alcohol, THC). In terms of emotional functioning, 5% had a diagnosis of a mood disorder, however overall, the frequency of depression symptoms was surprisingly low. In contrast, daytime sleepiness and fatigue were moderate-to-high. Conclusion(s): Adolescents presenting with DSPD possess a number of clinical characteristics that may factor into the maintenance of their sleep disorder.

Unlike polysomnography (PSG), these measures can be used to assess typical sleep habits over more than just a few nights. However, not much is known about the longitudinal reliability of these measures over months as typical use of these measures spans 1-2 weeks. Therefore, there exists a need to examine the stability and agreement of these measures over time. Method(s): Actigraphy and sleep diary data from community-dwelling individuals, ages 25-50, were obtained (n = 20). Sixteen participants were adherent to the study protocol for >= 70% of nights across the 1-year time period. Data were examined relative to the temporal consistency of both sleep measures, as well as fluctuations in subjectiveobjective disagreement. Result(s): Mean sleep duration across all participants was 480.33 minutes (SD = 80.35) for sleep diary and 436.46 minutes (SD = 74.76) for actigraphy. Mean days recorded was 276.38 days (range 228-326). Bland-Altman plots revealed good agreement between sleep diary and actigraphy, with a systematic over-reporting of sleep duration in sleep diary (mean difference - 42.26 minutes, SD = 65.41). Stability over time was high. When sleep duration from the first 30 days was subtracted from the 30 days of month 8 (to examine consistency across subjects), the mean difference was -1.81 mins for actigraphy and -7.32 mins for diary. Subjective-objective discrepancies were also consistent over time, with a mean of 5.31 fewer minutes of discrepancy at 8 months versus the first 30 days. Further analyses are forthcoming, including signal processing approaches. Conclusion(s): Longitudinal agreement of actigraphy and prospective sleep diary measures of total sleep time was highly stable over 8-11 months. The discrepancy between subjective and objective measures remained stable over time. Results suggest that shorter duration assessments (< 2-4 weeks) may be sufficient for characterizing typical sleep habits across multiple months.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,*sleep;*sleep time;*actimetry;*organization;habit;human;night;community;reliability;signal processing;polysomnography;information processing,,,,Longitudinal analysis of sleep duration using actigraphy and sleep diary: Stability and agreement over 8-11 months,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Treatment often involves hypnotic and/or anxiolytic medications with disturbing side effects that increase patients' drug load. Most hypnosedatives are prescribed based on subjective complaints, but little information is published on the relationship between self-report and recorded sleep in this population. Hence, the present study examined the correlation between subjective and objective evaluation of sleep latency and sleep quality among subjects with PTSD and Schizophrenia (Sch). Method(s): The sample comprised two groups: 13 subjects with PTSD (mean age=45.4, SD=11.8; 8 M, 5 F) and 34 with Sch (mean age=45.4, SD=9.7; 20 M, 14 F).

Subjective report of poor sleep does not appear to correlate well with actual sleep disturbances in this population. However, comparisons of objective and subjective sleep measures have compared self-report to overnight polysomnography, or a few days of actigraphy. These short-term objective assessments may not capture normal sleep behavior for a given individual. We investigated the use of a novel approach for objective assessment of sleep behaviors. Method(s): Thirty-seven ambulatory community-dwelling elderly subjects (86.8 +/- 4.8 years) currently being monitored in their homes as part of an ongoing study were included in this analysis. All subjects had a GDS < 5 (not depressed), and an MMSE > 24 (not demented). The homes of these subjects have been instrumented with pyroelectric sensors, from which data we derived measures of time to bed, time to rise, sleep latency, number of times out of bed and using the bathroom, and restlessness at night over a four week period. Self-report measures of sleep quality were also collected for comparison. Result(s): The daily measures of sleep latency, restlessness, time in bed, and number of times subjects got up at night varied widely throughout the month for the majority of subjects. There was a trend towards subjects underestimating their time in bed (t44 = 2.02, P = 0.10) and over-reporting their sleep latency (t43 = 1.78, P = 0.06). Subjects who under-reported their sleep latency actually had the longest sleep latency of any group. Subjects visited the bathroom 96.7% of the times they got up at night, suggesting this may have been the reason the subjects got up. Conclusion(s): Self-report data did not correlate closely with our objective data.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,*sleep;*self report;*health care organization;night;restlessness;adult;bath;population;polysomnography;community;aged;sensor;actimetry;Mini Mental State Examination;sleep disorder,,,,Comparison of novel daily objective sleep measures and self-report,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hermans, Electrical Engineering, Eindhoven, Netherlands","Objectives/Introduction: People with insomnia often overestimate their sleep onset latency (SOL) compared to objective sleep recordings. Previous research results suggest that sleep fragmentation at the beginning of the night influences the perception of the SOL. Recently, we introduced a model quantifying the relationship between sleep fragmentation and sleep onset (mis)perception. Here, we applied this model on sleep recordings from a within-subject placebo-controlled medication study, to examine whether the effect of zopiclone on sleep (mis)perception can be attributed to predictable alterations in sleep fragmentation at the beginning of the night. Method(s): We analyzed polysomnographic recordings from a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover design, with three groups (insomnia patients chronically using hypnotics, N = 15; insomnia patients infrequently using hypnotics, N = 16; healthy controls, N = 15). The experimental intervention was a single oral dose of zopiclone 7.5 mg. The amount of sleep onset misperception was calculated as the difference between objective and subjective SOL. Subsequently, we divided sleep onset misperception into a component explained by sleep fragmentation, calculated as subjective SOL estimated by the model, and an unexplained component, represented by the residual error of the model. Multi-way ANOVA was used to assess the influence of group and treatment on the amount of misperception, estimated SOL, and residual error. Result(s): A significant effect of group and treatment was found for the amount of misperception (Group F = 6.1, p < 0.01, Treatment F = 10.8, p < 0.001, Group x Treatment F = 2.5, p = 0.089). The amount of misperception was smaller during the zopiclone night. Post-hoc analyses indicated that healthy controls had less misperception compared to both frequent users (W = 652, p = 0.016) and infrequent users (W = 587.5, p = 0.021). The estimated subjective SOL was significantly affected by treatment (Group F = 3.6, p = 0.031; Treatment F = 16.0, p = < 0.001, Group x Treatment F = 1.0, p = 0.377), and was shorter during the zopiclone night. No significant effects were found for the residual error (Group F = 1.6, p = 0.204; Treatment F = 0.203, p = 0.654; Group x Treatment F = 1.0, p = 0.368). Conclusion(s): The unexplained component of sleep onset misperception possibly includes psychological traits, time estimation ability and hyperarousal. Because the residual error did not change between test conditions, we conclude that zopiclone influenced sleep onset misperception largely by means of predictable changes of sleep architecture.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,adult;analysis of variance;clinical article;conference abstract;controlled study;crossover procedure;double blind procedure;drug therapy;female;human;insomnia;male;night;oral drug administration;post hoc analysis;*sleep latency;*time perception;hypnotic agent;*placebo;zopiclone,,,,Within-subject variations of sleep (MIS) perception in a placebo-controlled medication study,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hsiou, Baylor University","Introduction: Polysomnography (PSG) is the gold standard for measuring sleep, but this method is cumbersome, costly, and sometimes does not reflect naturalistic sleep patterns. Leading technology companies have developed non-wearable sleep tracking devices that have attracted public interest. However, the accuracy of these devices has either been shown to be poor or the validation tests have not been conducted by independent laboratories without potential conflicts of interest. Relative to PSG and actigraphy, and under conditions of both normal and restricted sleep, we assessed the accuracy of early and newer versions of a non-wearable sleep tracking device (Beddit, Apple Inc.). Method(s): Participants were 35 healthy young adults (Mage=18.97, SD=0.95 years; 77.14% female; 42.86% Caucasian). We randomly assigned them to go to bed at 10:30pm (normal sleep) or 1:30am (restricted sleep) in a controlled sleep laboratory environment. Lights-on was 7:00am for all participants. Sleep was measured by the early version (3.0) or newer version (3.5) of a non-wearable device that uses a sensor strip to measure movement, heart rate, and breathing. We also measured PSG, wristband actigraphy, and self-report. For each device, we tested accuracy against PSG for total sleep time (TST), sleep efficiency (SE%), sleep onset latency (SOL), and wake after sleep onset (WASO). Result(s): While the early version displayed poor reliability (ICCs<0.30), the newer version of the non-wearable device yielded excellent reliability with PSG under both normal and restricted sleep conditions. Not only was agreement excellent for TST (ICC=0.96) and SE% (ICC=0.98), but agreement was also excellent for the notoriously difficult metrics of SOL (ICC=0.92) and WASO (ICC=0.92). This newer version significantly outperformed clinical grade actigraphy (ICCs often in the 0.40 to 0.75 range), and self-reported sleep (ICCs often below 0.40). Conclusion(s): Surprisingly, a non-wearable device demonstrated greater agreement with PSG than clinical grade actigraphy. Though the field has generally been skeptical of commercial non-wearable devices, this independent validation provides optimism that some such devices would be efficacious for research in healthy adults. Future work is needed to test the validity of this device in older adults and clinical populations.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,actimetry;adult;aged;apple;breathing;Caucasian;clinical article;conference abstract;controlled study;female;heart rate;human;human experiment;male;nonhuman;optimism;polysomnography;randomized controlled trial;reliability;self report;sensor;sleep efficiency;sleep latency;validity;*wake after sleep onset;young adult;Sleep,,,,Validation of a non-wearable sleep tracking device in healthy adults under normal and restricted sleep conditions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of the study was to report rates of agreement between actigraphy (ACT), manuscript sleep diary (SD) and an electronic sleep diary (ESD) application for handheld device. Method(s): 38 healthy adults (29 +/- 9 yrs; 45% women) recorded sleep data for 6 to 7 days. Participants wore wrist actigraph and used an application for handheld device (Scextan) set on one-minute intervals. For each one-minute epoch, Sadeh's algorithm was used to score actigraph recordings as wake or sleep. Nineteen participants also recorded data from a manuscript sleep diary at 15-minute intervals. Total sleep time (TST), wake after sleep onset (WASO), and sleep efficiency (SE) were derived from the three methods. Sleep onset latency (SOL) was determined from ESD bedtime information to ACT and ESD sleep onset. Result(s): Inter-group deviation analysis between ACT and ESD did not show statistical differences (t test). TST analysis revealed better correlation (Spearman) and agreement rate (using the Bland and Altman method) for ACT vs ESD (bias = -6.2 min; SD = 10.9; rho = 0.93; p < 0.0001), than for ACT vs SD (bias = -5.1 min; SD = 30.1; rho = 0,70; p < 0.0001). SOL analysis showed high correlation and good agreement between ACT and ESD (bias = 3.7 min; SD = 10.1; rho = 0.80; p < 0.0001). WASO correlation coefficient was low for ACT vs ESD (rho = 0.14) as for ACT vs SD (rho = 0,32). SE analysis also revealed poor correlation for ACT vs ESD (rho = 0,18) and for ACT vs SD (rho = 0,25). Conclusion(s): Electronic sleep diary is a valid method to measure TST in healthy subjects and is more accurate than a manuscript sleep diary. SOL measurement appears to be the most efficient for short latencies. We agree that subjective assessments need to be supplemented by the use of an accelerometer to detect awakenings during sleep. Nevertheless, electronic sleep diary application on handheld device could offer more educational facilities than manuscript sleep diary and remains cheaper than the actigraph.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,*sleep;*device;*sleep parameters;publication;human;normal human;latent period;recording;wrist;algorithm;sleep time;Student t test;correlation coefficient;arousal;education;actimetry;female;accelerometer;recombinant erythropoietin,,,,"Can handheld device accurately measure sleep parameters?

Purpose(s): To examine the associations between subjective and objective sleep duration and awakenings among adults enrolled in a behavioral weight loss study. Method(s): Self-report data included responses to the questions ""How many hours of sleep did you get?"" and ""Number of awakenings?"" collected each morning by ecological momentary assessment. Objective measures included actigraphic data on sleep duration and awakenings collected for 7 days at 6 and 12 mos. Concordance between measures was examined using linear mixed models predicting self-report measures of sleep from objectively measured sleep. Result(s): The sample (N = 137) was 89.8% female and 81.8% white with a mean age of 51.5 +/- 9.9 yrs. Based on self-report, sleep duration was 417.2 +/- 77.7 min./night with 1.7 +/- 1.5 awakenings. Based on actigraphy, sleep duration was 413.1 +/- 79.5 min./night with 33.0 +/- 14.1 awakenings. The fitted model for sleep duration yielded an estimated intercept of 197.3 min. (95% CI, 178.0, 216.6) and slope of 0.54 (95% CI, 0.49, 0.58). In the scatter plot of self-report against objective sleep (Fig 1a), the plotted points were well-scattered about the 45-degree line suggesting that self-report min. of sleep predicted objective min. of sleep. The fitted model for awakenings yielded an estimated intercept of 0.95 awakenings (95% CI, 0.66, 1.2) and slope of 0.02 (95% CI, 0.015, 0.028). In the scatter plot of self-report against objective awakenings (Fig 1b), all of the plotted points fell below the 45-degree line indicating that self-report drastically underestimated actigraphic awakenings. Conclusion(s): Self-reported sleep duration was a good indicator of objective sleep duration, while self-reported awakenings significantly underestimated actigraphic awakenings. Sleep is multidimensional and both subjective and objective measures are needed to capture its various features.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,actimetry;adult;arousal;body weight loss;controlled study;*ecological momentary assessment;female;human;major clinical study;male;middle aged;night;self report;*sleep time;conference abstract,,,,Subjective versus objective measures of sleep: Results from an ecological momentary assessment study,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Actigraphy and sleep diaries are typically completed in conjunction with one another. In some cases it may be preferable to use only sleep diaries. However, subjects might not be able to accurately record their sleep time and wake up time for various reasons. We aimed to evaluate the agreement between actigraphy and sleep diary on sleep time, wake up time and sleep duration. Method(s): Eighteen participants (6M, 12F, mean age = 31.2, SD = 12.7) were recruited from a psychiatry clinic. Participants were instructed to wear a wrist actigraph (Actiwatch-64, MiniMitter) and complete a daily sleep diary for at least 7 days. Result(s): Actigraphy was found to estimate sleep onset time 7.73 (SD = 43.2) minutes after self-reported sleep onset time (p < 0.005). Differences between self-reported and actigraphic wake up time and total sleep time were found to be nonsignificant. Absolute differences between self-reported and actigraphically estimated time and duration was calculated. On average, the discrepancy between both measurements for sleep onset time was 25.38 (SD = 35.79) minutes, wake up time was 23.24 (SD = 36.5) minutes and total sleep time was 35.48 (SD = 46.6) minutes. Intraclass correlation analyses were performed on sleep time and duration. Significant correlations were found on sleep onset time (r = 0.907, 95% CI 0.880-0.928), wake up time (r = 0.924, 95% CI 0.902-0.941), and total sleep time (r = 0.872, 95% CI 0.836-0.901) between actigraphy and sleep diary. Discussion(s): The results suggest that self-reported sleep time, wake up time and sleep duration were very similar to that from wrist actigraphy. However, there is a subset of participants whom self-reported and actigraphic sleep measures were poorly correlated. Due to the small sample size, we were unable to determine subject characteristics that predict high agreement between actigraphic and self-reported sleep measures. Future studies with larger sample size are warranted to identify groups that can complete sleep diary with high accuracy, therefore suitable to be studied with sleep diary alone.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,*sleep;*night sleep;*actimetry;*sleep time;*wrist;*technology;sample size;psychiatry;hospital;correlation analysis;Wrist,,,,Comparison of sleep time and duration between sleep diary and wrist actigraphy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Identifying any systematic biases across groups and subgroups (e.g. sex, insomnia, sleep apnea, depression) in sleep measured objectively compared to by questionnaire could inform research aimed at understanding sleep health disparities. Method(s): We investigated the concordance of self-reported habitual sleep duration compared to actigraphy-measured sleep duration across Whites, Blacks, Hispanics and Chinese in the US. We analyzed data from a racially/ethnically diverse sample of participants in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis Sleep Study. Self-administered questionnaires were used to measure habitual sleep duration (based on self-reported bed and wake times) and 7-day wrist actigraphy objectively measured sleep duration and sleep continuity. Spearman correlation coefficients, Kappa statistics, Bland-Altman plots, and linear regression models were used to determine concordance of actigraphy-determined and self-reported sleep duration. Result(s): Among 1,912 adults (ages 54-93), 37% were non-Hispanic Whites, 28% Blacks, 24%) Hispanics, and 11% Chinese. Forty-six percent were males, 8% had doctor diagnosed sleep apnea, and 6% insomnia. Actigraphy-determined time interval in bed vs. sleep time more closely correlated with self-reported sleep duration across race. Moderate correlations of self-reported and objective measures of sleep duration were observed (p = 0.40 overall; 0.49 for Whites; 0.28 Blacks; 0.41 Hispanics; and 0.38 Chinese). When sleep duration was classified categorically as short (< 6 hours), recommended (7-9 hours), and long (> 10 hours), fair agreement was observed among Whites (K = 0.27) and Blacks (K = 0.21) with slight agreement among Hispanics (K = 0.16) and Chinese (K = 0.13). Each race/ethnicity overestimated their sleep duration, and non-Hispanic Whites (27 minutes [95% confidence interval (CI): 23-31]) overestimated more than Blacks (13 [8-19]) and Chinese (16 [8-23]) but not Hispanics (23 [18-29]). Sex, insomnia, sleep apnea, and depression did not significantly modify the relationships. Conclusion(s): Correlations between self-reported and actigraphy-based sleep duration as well as biases in measurements varied by race/ethnicity. The highest correlations but greatest over-estimation of sleep duration occurred among non-Hispanic Whites. Further research is needed to understand the implications of differences in sleep measurement properties on assessments of sleep in multi-racial populations.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,*sleep;*sleep time;*human;*adult;*United States;*organization;actimetry;sleep disordered breathing;insomnia;Hispanic;population;questionnaire;kappa statistics;correlation coefficient;wrist;atherosclerosis;confidence interval;male;physician;model;health disparity;linear regression analysis;statistical bias;Hispanic Americans;African Continental Ancestry Group;United States,,,,"Objective and subjective sleep duration among Whites, Blacks, Hispanics, and Chinese adults in the United States",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Intervention studies should include patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) of sleep quality and objective measures for comprehensive sleep evaluation, e.g. polysomnography (PSG) or a wrist actigraph. Study aim was to examine sleep quality and the agreement between PROMs and objective measures of sleep quality in advanced cancer. Method(s): PROMs and objective measures of sleep quality were monitored during one night in palliative care in-patients. All patients used a WHO Step III opioid for cancer pain. Patients reported symptom intensity and sleep quality using the EAPC basic dataset (NRS 0-10; higher scores indicate worse symptoms/poorer sleep) and factors affecting sleep, sleep duration and awakening in a sleep diary. Overall sleep quality was measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) global score (range; 0-21; score >5 indicates poor sleep). Actiwatch 2 (Philips Respironics) and Actiware software (version 6.0.9) were used to collect and analyze actigraphy data. PROMs and actigraphy total sleep time (TST), sleep-onset latency (SOL), number of awakenings (NWAK) and wake after sleep onset (WASO) were compared with paired t tests or Wilcoxon signed ranks tests as appropriate. Result(s): From January 2016 to March 2017 128 in-patients were screened. None were eligible for PSG due to frailty. Actigraphy and symptom data were available on 40 of 41 patients: males 60%; median age 70 (range 46-91); median oral daily morphine equivalent dose 80 mg/24h (10-2250 mg), median Karnofsky performance score 50 (20-90). All had metastatic disease and 33 (83%) were dead 6 months after inclusion. Mean NRS sleep quality was 3.0 (+/-2.8) and mean PSQI global score was 6.5 (+/-3.4). Cancer pain (mean NRS 2.3) was the most frequently reported factor for disturbed sleep. Paired differences between PROMs and actigraphy were significant in terms of number of awakenings (mean NWAK: 2 (+/- 28) vs 29 (+/- 28) p < .001). Significant differences were not found for total sleep time (mean TST: 439 min (+/- 101) vs 455 min (+/- 162) p = .469), minutes before falling asleep (mean SOL: 46 min (+/- 65) vs 37 min. (+/- 53) p= .695) or total time awake during the night (mean WASO: 33 min (+/- 25) vs 50 min (+/- 44) p = .193). Conclusion(s): In this palliative care cohort, PSG was not feasible, while actigraphy was well accepted. Pain led to impaired sleep quality. Actigraphy measured more awakenings than self-report.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,actimetry;*advanced cancer;aged;arousal;cancer pain;*cancer patient;controlled study;drug therapy;frailty;hospital patient;human;Karnofsky Performance Status;major clinical study;male;metastasis;*outcome assessment;palliative therapy;*patient-reported outcome;Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index;polysomnography;self report;sleep latency;*sleep quality;sleep time;software;wakefulness;Wilcoxon signed ranks test;morphine;conference abstract,,,,Patient-reported outcome measures versus objective assessment of sleep in patients with advanced cancer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this study was to examine the discrepancy between ACT and PSG and the associations of these measures with apnea, selfreported sleep quality and physical function in heart failure (HF) patients, a group with high levels of sleep fragmentation. Method(s): The sample included a cross-sectional design and patients with stable HF recruited from evidence-based HF disease management programs. We recorded total sleep time (TST), wake after sleep onset (WASO), sleep latency (SL), and sleep efficiency (SE) with polysomnography (PSG) and wrist-actigraphy (ACT), and recorded the apneahypopnea index (AHI) with PSG. We obtained self-reports of sleep with the Pittsburgh sleep quality Index (PSQI), difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep (DIMS), and SF-36 (physical function). Cor relations between ACT and PSG were calculated, and factors associated with the discrepancy were assessed. Regression coefficients of the sleep characteristics from each device on the apnea and self-reported variables were compared. Result(s): The sample included 172 HF patients [65.3% male (M (SD) age = 60.3 +16.1 years)]. The two measures were highly correlated (r = 0.618) on TST but poorly correlated (r = 0.129-0.383) on SL, WASO, and SE. Older age, poor sleep quality, AHI, and comorbidity were associated with the discrepancy between PSG and ACT-measures. PSG measured WASO and SE were explained by AHI (p < .01) but none of the others variables. ACT WASO and SE explained the AHI, PSQI, DIMS, and physical function (p < .02). ACT SL explained poor sleep quality and physical function. After controlling for demographic characteristics, only the ACT measures had significant associations with those variables. Conclusion(s): ACT is a precise measure of PSG - recorded TST but there is substantive discrepancy in WASO, SL, and SE. Regardless of the discrepancy, the ACT measures better explain sleep-related outcomes than PSG.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,*sleep;*actimetry;*wrist;*patient;*heart failure;*human;*organization;*polysomnography;sleep quality;devices;apnea;Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index;self report;population;sleep time;disease management;evidence based practice;cross-sectional study;demography;comorbidity;male;Polysomnography;Heart Failure;Wrist,,,,Discrepancy between sleep measures obtained with polysomnography and wrist-actigraphy in stable heart failure patients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Actigraphy may be an important clinical and research tool for monitoring sleep changes in this population, but has not yet been systematically validated against polysomnography or sleep diary. The present study compares actigraphy, polysomnography and sleep diary estimates of sleep onset latency, wake after sleep onset, number of awakenings, total sleep time and sleep efficiency across two nights of assessment. Method(s): Twenty-seven individuals who met diagnostic criteria for bipolar disorder type I or II and were currently between mood episodes, along with 27 matched controls with no history of psychopathology or sleep disturbance, underwent two nights of laboratory monitoring via polysomnography, actigraphy (Actiwatch AW-64), and sleep diary. The total sample included 108 comparison nights. Result(s): Sleep parameter estimates from actigraphy and polysomnography did not differ between the two groups or across the two nights for sleep onset latency, wake after sleep onset, number of awakenings, total sleep time or sleep efficiency percentage. Parameter estimates were highly correlated (.49 <= r <= .92) with the exception of a modest correlation observed for SOL (r = .33). Estimates between actigraphy and sleep diary were more variable, with actigraphy underestimating sleep onset latency (p < .001) and overestimating number of awakenings (p < .001) when compared to sleep diaries. Bland-Altman plots of all sleep parameters suggested the medium wake threshold algorithm in the actigraphy software was the most concordant with polysomnography and diaries across the five sleep parameters. Concordance between actigraphy, polysomnography and sleep diary was unrelated to insomnia presence or medication use. Conclusion(s): Actigraphy is a valid tool for measuring sleep length and fragmentation in bipolar disorder, and demonstrates particularly favorable concordance with polysomnography in this population.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,*sleep;*bipolar disorder;*polysomnography;*organization;*actimetry;night;latent period;arousal;sleep parameters;population;monitoring;mood;sleep time;computer program;algorithm;laboratory;sleep disorder;mental disease;diagnosis;human;insomnia;drug therapy;diseases;Bipolar Disorder;Polysomnography,,,,"Comparison between actigraphy, polysomnography and sleep diary in individuals with bipolar disorder and healthy controls",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Kay, Psychiatry, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, United States","Introduction: Sleep discrepancy (Sdisc), the absolute time difference between self-report and objective measures of sleep, increases with age and with insomnia diagnosis. Utilizing daily sleep diaries and actigraphy, Sdisc can be characterized by its mean level as well as its night-to-night variability. Recent evidence suggested cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTI) decreases Sdisc in older adults with insomnia (OAI). We hypothesized that CBTI will signiicantly reduce both mean level and variability in Sdisc, and that the magnitude of these reductions will be associated with the magnitude of symptom improvement in OAI. Method(s): Participants included 50 OAI (60 y+ , 35F) who completed a 7 day sleep diary concurrent with actigraphy (Actiwatch-2) pre- and post-CBTI. Daily discrepancy in sleep onset latency (SOLdisc) and wake after sleep onset (WASOdisc) were calculated by subtracting daily actigraphy values from respective diary estimates. Each participant's mean and standard deviation (night-to-night variability) of these variables were computed pre- and post-treatment. Symptom improvements were determined by pre- to post-treatment reductions in Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) scores. Repeated measures ANOVA and hierarchical linear modeling assessed pre-post changes in Sdisc variables and their associations with ISI changes. Result(s): Treatment with CBTI resulted in signiicant reductions in mean level SOLdisc [17.84 vs. 8.59 min, p < .01] and WASOdisc [17.42 vs. -5.73 min, p < .001]. Night-to-night variability in WASOdisc also declined signiicantly [43.20 vs. 26.41 min, p < .001]. Individuals with greater preto post-treatment decline in mean level SOLdisc, mean level WASOdisc, or WASOdisc variability had greater decline in pre- to post-treatment ISI score [F(1,94.23) = 5.42, p < .05; F(1,63.96) = 15.29, p < .001; F(1,92.84) = 14.58, p < .001; respectively]. Conclusion(s): Results demonstrated that insomnia symptom improvements following CBTI corresponded with reduced mean level Sdisc and WASOdisc variability. Causal relationships remain unclear. We posit Sdisc predisposes and perpetuates late-life insomnia and that improved Sdisc relects realignment of perceptual and global sleep processes.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,*sleep;*insomnia;*organization;*adult;*cognitive therapy;night;actimetry;human;latent period;self report;Insomnia Severity Index;model;diagnosis;analysis of variance;Behavior Therapy;Cognitive Therapy,,,,Decreased sleep discrepancy is associated with amount of improvement in insomnia severity following cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia in older adults,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Kay, University of Pittsburgh, Department of Psychiatry, Pittsburgh, PA, United States","Introduction: Sleep discrepancy, the difference between objectively measured and self-reported sleep, is common in insomnia. We hypothesize that sleep discrepancy results from persistent activation of brain centers associated with conscious awareness during NREM sleep including the insula, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and precuneus, whose activation is not reflected in traditional Polysomnographic (PSG) sleep measures. This study tested whether sleep discrepancy correlates with greater glucose metabolism in these regions during NREM sleep. Method(s): The study sample (M = 36 years old, range 27-50) included 20 patients with insomnia who underwent NREM sleep [18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography scans. Sleep onset latency discrepancy (SOLd) on the night of the scan was calculated by subtracting PSG values from sleep diary self-reports the following morning. Three a priori regions of interest (ROIs) hypothesized to be associated with conscious awareness were examined: insula, ACC, and precuneus. SPM8 software was used to investigate whether relative glucose metabolism in these ROIs correlated with SOLd on the night of the scan (voxel-wise, p < 0.001 uncorrected). Cluster-wise extent thresholds for ROIs were computed using AlphaSim (p < 0.05). Result(s): Patients with greater sleep discrepancy (self-report SOL > PSG SOL) had significantly greater relative glucose metabolism in the right insula (peak voxel xyz = 36-6 8, Z = 3.95, p = 0.018; k = 54, r2 = 0.56), left insula (peakvoxel xyz = -28,16, -10, Z = 3.71, p = 0.040; k = 46, r2 = 0.47), and left ACC (peak voxel xyz = -6, 28, 28, Z = 4.02, p = 0.010; k=90, r2 = 0.59) during NREM sleep (all clusters p < 0.05 corrected). Sleep discrepancy was not associated with lower relative glucose metabolism in any ROI. Conclusion(s): Heightened activation of the insula and ACC during NREM sleep may contribute to continued conscious awareness. Although traditionally disregarded as misperception or measurement error, sleep discrepancy may represent a regionally-specific dysregulation of brain activity that is not captured by PSG. Future studies should address the consequences of this regionalized sleep disturbance on cognitive and affective functioning.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,*sleep;*insula;*organization;*patient;*human;*insomnia;*anterior cingulate;*glucose metabolism;self report;precuneus;night;latent period;positron emission tomography;electroencephalogram;measurement error;computer program;sleep disorder;brain;deoxyglucose;fluorine 18;Gyrus Cinguli;Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders,,,,Regional glucose metabolism in the anterior cingulate cortex and insula correlates with subjective-objective sleep discrepancy in patients with insomnia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Kelly, Melbourne Sleep Disorders Centre, East Melbourne, VIC, Australia","Introduction: Having an objective measure of sleep is important in the clinical management of people with insomnia. It forms the basis of cognitive behavioural strategies such as sleep restriction, but for many people with insomnia there is significant sleep state misperception, which can make subjective sleep measurement inaccurate. People with insomnia can find polysomnography (PSG) uncomfortable and intimidating, and polysomnography only allows a single night of recording. As such, a single night PSG may not representative of their usual experience and is subject to first-night effect, particularly in the sleep laboratory. For this reason, historically, in complex cases, PSG was performed for consecutive nights. We aimed to assess the feasibility and utility of using a simple multi-night EEG recording device to measure sleep over 3 nights at home in people with insomnia. Method/results: Eleven subjects with insomnia were studied. There were 7 females and 4 males, and the mean age was 39. Participants had severe insomnia (mean ISI 22), but were not sleepy (mean ESS 3). They scored in the moderate range for both depression (mean PHQ-9 16) and anxiety (mean GAD-7 11). On night 1, subjective TST (4.86 hrs) was 2.12 hrs shorter (p = 0.007) than objective TST (6.97 hrs). On night 2, these values were 5.52 hrs vs 6.84 hrs (p = 0.05), and by night 3 the difference was smaller, 5.45 hrs vs 6.54 hrs and no longer statistically significant (p = 0.19). Subjective sleep onset latency was longer than objective sleep onset latency on night 1 (67.0 min vs 8.27 min, p = 0.0005), night 2 (75.3 min vs 4.67 min, p < 0.0004) and night 3 (101.7 min vs 33.7 min, p = 0.03). There was significant variation in subjective and objective sleep measurements across the 3 nights within individuals. Conclusion(s): This group of people with insomnia demonstrated significant sleep state misperception, for both sleep length and time taken for sleep onset. Having a combination of objective and subjective measurement of sleep that occurred over multiple nights and, taking into account the variations between nights, provides accurate data for creating sleep restriction prescriptions. In addition, the data collected can be used to support cognitive therapy, helping address disordered cognitions around sleep, by helping people better understand the differences between perceived and objectively measured sleep.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,*sleep;*night;*insomnia;*recording;*electroencephalogram;human;polysomnography;latent period;anxiety;male;female;cognition;cognitive therapy;prescription;devices;laboratory;Electroencephalography;Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders,,,,Multi-night EEG recording during sleep can provide important information in managing insomnia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Kelly, Psychiatry, Univ of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, United States","Introduction: Objective and subjective sleep measurements in Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) have mixed results. Studies show, compared to polysomnography, selfreports overestimate wake after sleep onset (WASO) and nocturnal motor activity in PTSD, while underestimating sleep eficiency (SE). Moreover, patients with MDD underestimate total sleep time. However, MDD and PTSD are highly comorbid, with MDD occurring in approximately 50-80% of individuals with PTSD. Therefore, examination of the congruence between sleep measures in this population is both warranted and clinically relevant. Method(s): Self-report sleep diaries were completed following a singlenight of polysomnography (PSG) by 40 male military veteran participants (49 + 13 years [SD]) with a diagnosis of comorbid PTSD and MDD. Zero-order correlations were used to examine the relationship between sleep diary and PSG variables. Result(s): Subjective versus objective sleep measures produced signiicant correlations on some sleep indices. In patients with PTSD and MDD subjective and objective measures of both total sleep time (TST; r = .59, p < .01) and WASO (r = .44, p < .05) were correlated. However, these patients misperceived sleep onset latency (SOL; r = .04, p = .78). Subjective sleep eficiency (SE), as calculated from sleep diary time in bed and TST, did not match objective SE (r = .05, p = .76). Conclusion(s): Patients with PTSD and MDD correctly perceive how long they sleep, as well as how long they are awake in the middle of the night. However, these patients may misperceive how long it takes to fall asleep. These results are in opposition to previous studies of patients with either MDD or PTSD alone. Many PTSD studies do not control for comorbidity, therefore, uncontrolled depression may complicate our understanding of sleep in PTSD. Further research exploring the role of each disorder in sleep may inform our understanding of their interaction in this population.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,"*sleep;*polysomnography;*organization;*posttraumatic stress disorder;human;patient;population;sleep time;examination;male;comorbidity;night;motor activity;diagnosis;veteran;army;latent period;self report;diseases;major depression;Comorbidity;Polysomnography;Depressive Disorder;Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic",,,,Sleep perception in comorbid posttraumatic stress disorder and depression; sleep diary versus polysomnography,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

No differences in sleep perception amongst diagnostic groups; obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), upper airway resistance syndrome (UARS), primary snoring and primary insomnia were observed. The aim of the current study is to evaluate if other factors contribute to TST perception. METHOD(S): One hudred and eighty (180) subjects were retrospectively divided into 3 groups: 1. normal estimators [within 1 standard deviation (SD)] 2. abnormal estimators [within 2 SDs] 3. severely abnormal estimators > 2SDs]. Standard deviation was relative to percent of estimated TST. Perception estimates were compared for each diagnostic group; primary insomnia, UARS/primary snoring and mild, moderate and severe OSA. The subjects' perception of how much they slept was compared with objectively determined TST by NPSG. Factors evaluated were: age, body mass index(BMI), apnea/hypoapnea index(AHI), sleep efficiency (SE), sleep onset (SO), SOREM, number of REM periods, REM time, number of total arousals, respiratory and non-respiratory arousals and number of stage shifts. Diagnostic NPSG inclusion criteria were normal REM sleep time, TST minimum = 4.5 hrs. Many exclusion criteria used, two were absence of REM altering medications or benzodiazepines. RESULT(S): Data showed that 121 (67%) of all subjects estimated TST to within 1SD, 29% within 2SDs and 4% > 2SDs, for their respective diagnostic group. Two macro-sleep factors appeared to significantly influence perception: TST [group 2, 352.4 +/- 30.1 < group 1 (324.5 +/- 37.3) p < 0.001] and the number of stage shifts [group 3 (109.4 +/- 10.5) < group 1 (154.6 +/- 44.4) < group 2 (155.2 +/- 54.4) p < 0.04]. No significant differences between groups were observed for any other sleep and demographic factors. CONCLUSION(S): Thirty-three percent(33%) of subjects with various disorders abnormally perceived their sleep. Subjects with the greatest sleep misperception had the lowest number of stage shifts.

Evidence suggests that REM sleep-related processes contribute to misperception of TST in primary insomnia. To date, no studies have examined sleep misperception in obstructive sleep apnea(OSA) or other sleep disorders. METHOD(S): A retrospective study was conducted to determine if a specific sleep disorder led to differences in sleep perception. One hundred and forty-two (142) subjects were divided into five groups: primary insomnia, upper airway resistance syndrome (UARS)/primary snoring, mild OSA, moderate OSA and severe OSA. The subjects' perception of how much they slept was compared with total sleep time (TST). Perception estimates were additionally quantified by looking at estimates relative to TST: 1. normal estimators within 1 standard deviation (SD) 2. abnormal estimators, 2SD 3. severely inaccurate estimators, 3SD. The subjects' age, BMI, TST and sleep efficiency (SE), REM and delta time were compared. The inclusion criteria were normal percentage of REM sleep, TST minimum of 4.5 hours and diagnostic NPSG. Many exclusion criteria were used. RESULT(S): The mean data for all subjects were: age 46.0 +/- 14.5; BMI 29.0 +/- 5.9; TST 368.4 +/- 37.9; SE 85.5 +/- 7.2; REM time 79.3 +/- 17.4; REM percentage 21.5 +/- 4.1; delta time 37.1 +/- 30.1; delta percentage 10.0 +/- 8.0. There were no statistically significant differences in the groups with respect to age, TST, SE, REM time, REM%, delta time and delta%. The mean age increase from normal to severely abnormal estimators. There were statistically significant differences in delta time, delta percent, time estimate and percentage of estimation between men and women. CONCLUSION(S): In subjects with approximately twenty percent (20%) of REM sleep, thirty-two (32%) with various disorders will not correctly perceived their sleep. There are no differences in perception among subjects with OSA and other disorders. As subjects age, the trend is, they do not accurately estimate their sleep. Women have more delta sleep but underestimate their sleep when compared to men.

Arousal misperception is a discrepancy between the number of perceived arousals relative to objectively defined arousals. To date, no studies have examined arousal perception in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) or other sleep disorders. The aim of this study was to evaluate the factors that affects subjects' perception of arousals and if these factors are similar to subjects who misperceive their total sleep time (TST). Method(s): A retrospective study was conducted with review of over twenty five hundred (2500) charts. Two hundred and ten (210), otherwise healthy patients were divided into five groups: primary insomnia; upper airway resistance syndrome (UARS)/primary snoring; mild, moderate and severe OSA. Subjective arousals, as documented by the patients after their PSG, were compared to objectively defined PSG arousals. The subjects' age, BMI, TST, TST sleep perception, sleep efficiency, stage shifts, REM and delta time were compared. The inclusion criteria were normal percentage of REM sleep and TST >= 4.5 hours on the diagnostic PSG. Result(s): The groups were compared on the continuous PSG variables using Bonferroni corrections for multiple comparisons. The UARS/primary snoring group differed significantly from the moderate and severe OSA groups in terms of perceived arousals relative to TST and perceptual arousal percentage. The UARS/primary snoring group perceived more arousals than the moderate and severe OSA groups. The UARS/ primary snoring group had more non-respiratory arousals compared to the other apneic groups but fewer than the insomnia group. For, the total number of scored arousals, there was a linear increase in arousals as OSA severity increased with the insomnia groups and UARS groups having fewest total arousals. The differences in total number of arousals was also significant. Stage shifts were not or very weakly correlated with arousal perception. The number of perceived arousals was weakly and negatively correlated with perception of TST. Conclusion(s): Although patients with UARS/primary snoring have fewer arousals, they perceive their arousals more than patients with moderate or severe OSA. The non-respiratory related arousals are probably perceived differently than respiratory arousal related perception.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,*arousal;*sleep;*patient;*health care organization;*sleep disorder;snoring;insomnia;diagnosis;upper airway resistance syndrome;REM sleep;polysomnography;sleep apnea syndrome;sleep time;retrospective study;Arousal;Sleep Disorders,,,,Arousal perception in patients with sleep disorders,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Types 3 and 4 home PSG do not monitor sleep and so rely on the patient's estimated sleep latency (SL) in the calculation of total sleep time, used to calculate the apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI). The aim of this analysis was to compare patients' estimated SL with objective measures in patients who underwent type 2 home PSG for diagnosis of OSA. Method(s): The subjects were 536 consecutive patients of one of the authors between November 2006 and January 2013. A standard questionnaire was completed by the patients the morning after the home PSG, which recorded the time of lights being turned off and estimated time to sleep onset and estimated sleep offset time. Estimated SL was derived from these two values. Measured SL on home PSG was scored based on the guidelines of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. Result(s): Only 530 patients were included in the analysis due to incomplete data in 6 patients. Median estimated SL was 20 minutes compared to 10 minutes for measured SL (p < 0.0001). 223 (42%) patients estimated their SL to be within (+/-) 10 minutes of measured SL. 43% of patients over-estimated their SL, while 15% under-estimated it. Bland- Altman analysis showed mean difference of 13 minutes with wide limits of agreement (95% limits of agreement: -89 and 116 minutes). There were no significant correlations between estimated SL and age, Epworth Sleepiness Scale score, body mass index, AHI and sleep efficiency. Discussion(s): The overall estimated SL in the patients was significantly longer than measured, although there was significant individual variability. There were no identified factors that influence SL estimation. Subjective estimation of SL should be interpreted with caution.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,*sleep;*human;*sleep disordered breathing;*patient;*polysomnography;diagnosis;apnea hypopnea index;sleep time;questionnaire;body mass;Epworth sleepiness scale;sleep medicine;Polysomnography;Sleep,,,,Comparison of estimated and measured sleep latency during home polysomnography among patients with suspected obstructive sleep apnoea,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it is unclear if the magnitude of the discrepancy between self-reported and objectively measured sleep differs depending on sleep location or levels of pre-sleep arousal (PSA). The purpose of this study was to determine whether the difference between selfreported and actigraphy measured sleep varied depending on sleep location, and if these differences were due to differences in PSA between the home and laboratory. Method(s): Data were gathered from 54 participants (Mage = 42.9 years-old, SD = 12.2). A majority were female (74%) and White/Caucasian (67%). Participants self-reported PSA, completed sleep diaries (i.e., subjective sleep), and wore actiwatches (i.e., objective sleep) for one night of sleep at home and in the laboratory. Misperceptions of total sleep time (TST) and sleep onset latency (SOL) were calculated by subtracting sleep diary self-reports from actigraphy calculated sleep estimates for each location. Result(s): Multiple Wilcoxin Signed-Rank tests were conducted to examine the discrepancy between self-repor ted and actigraphy measured sleep at home and in the laboratory. Self-reported SOLs were greater than actigraphy measured SOLs at home (z = -4.07, p < 0.01) and in the laboratory (z = -5.22, p < 0.01). Self-reported TSTs were less than actigraphy measured TSTs in the laboratory (z = -2.77, p = 0.01). The discrepancy between self-reported and actigraphy measured SOL (z = -2.46, p = 0.01) and TST (z = -3.01, p < 0.01) was smaller at home than in the laboratory. Linear regression equations revealed that differences between home and laboratory PSA did not significantly predict differences in home and laboratory SOL and TST discrepancy. Conclusion(s): These data indicate that discrepancies between self-reported and acitgraphy measured sleep are present in both home and laboratory settings, and that estimates of objective and subjective sleep discrepancies based on one night of laboratory data may over-estimate the severity of the problem. Therefore, researchers and clinicians should consider how the method and location of sleep assessment they use in their studies and clinical practice impacts sleep and the results of research and clinical assessments.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,*sleep;*organization;*laboratory;actimetry;human;night;sleep time;clinical practice;linear regression analysis;latent period;self report;arousal;scientist;insomnia;clinical assessment;patient;female,,,,A comparison of the discrepancy between selfreported and objectively measured sleep at home and in the laboratory,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this study was to examine the relationships among perceptions of sleep, SQ, PA, and NA in first-time mothers in the Short-Term Postpartum (ST-PP; 3-6 months). It was hypothesized that discrepancies between objective and subjective sleep would be related to lower perceived SQ, lower PA, and greater NA. Method(s): Longitudinal data were analyzed from a week-long study investigating sleep during the ST-PP. Data were gathered from 46 first-time mothers (93% Caucasian; M Age = 30.11 years). Participants reported daily PA, NA, and SQ, completed daily sleep diaries (i.e., subjective sleep), and wore actiwatches (i.e., objective sleep) for 7 days. Misperceptions of time in bed (TIB), total sleep time (TST), and sleep onset latency (SOL) were calculated by subtracting sleep diary self-reports from actigraphy calculated sleep estimates. Result(s): Linear mixed model analyses showed that, on nights when participants had larger discrepancies between subjective and objective TIB, SQ was higher (beta = 0.0086, p < 0.01). SQ was lower on days with larger differences between subjective and objective TST (beta = -0.0085, p < 0.01). The discrepancy between subjective and objective SOL was smaller on days when participants reported higher PA (beta = -10.24, p < 0.01). Daily NA and PA were not significantly related to discrepancies between objective and subjective TIB or TST. Conclusion(s): These data indicate that the more accurate participants were in reporting TST and the less accurate they were in reporting TIB, the higher they rated their SQ. Participants with higher PA were also more accurate in reporting SOL.

However, the results of studies of the subjective perception of sleep time and associated factors remain controversial. This study examined the mismatch between the subjective perception of sleep time and objective findings. We also investigated the characteristics associated with the mismatch in insomnia patients. Method(s): This study reviewed the results of nocturnal polysomnography, a subjective questionnaire after sleep, and the medical records of 315 patients who were referred to the sleep clinic at Chonnam National University Hospital from January 2010 to August 2011. Of the 315 patients, 121 were diagnosed with insomnia and these were classified into groups underestimating (n = 56) and not underestimating (n = 65) the total sleep time (TST), based on a 2-h time difference between the subjective perception of TST and the objective TST from polysomnography. The demographic characteristics of the two groups were compared, including age, sex, type of insomnia (psychophysiological insomnia, insomnia due to a mental disorder, physiological insomnia, and unspecified), use of sleep-promoting medications, polysomnography findings, and subjective reports. Result(s): For the insomnia patients, nocturnal polysomnography showed a TST of 343.7+/-91.3 min and a sleep latency of 30.5+/-50.4 min, while the subjective reports showed a total sleep time of 233.7+/-143.7 min and sleep latency of 88.9+/-82.0 min. The group underestimating TST was significantly (p = 0.043) older than the group not underestimating TST (56.3+/-11.8 vs. 50.7+/-18.1 years). Compared with the group not underestimating TST, polysomnography of the group underestimating TST showed a longer total sleep time (366.1+/-77.0 vs. 324.4+/-98.5 min, p = 0.012), shorter sleep latency (16.3+/-23.1 vs. 42.7+/-63.1, p = 0.002), and less slow-wave sleep (2.2+/-3.3 vs. 5.9+/-6.8 min, p<0.001). Subjective reports of the group underestimating TST showed a significantly shorter TST (135.0+/-88.4 vs. 318.7+/-127.1, p<0.001) and lighter sleep depth (2(1-3) vs. 3(2-4), p = 0.005), compared to the other group. There were no significant differences between the groups in terms of sex, type of insomnia, and use of sleep-promoting medication. Conclusion(s): There was a significant mismatch between the subjective perception of sleep time and objective polysomnography findings in insomnia patients. The group underestimating TST reported a shorter total sleep time and longer sleep latency subjectively, while polysomnography indicated a longer total sleep time and shorter sleep latency. In addition, the proportion of the third stage of sleep was significantly lower in this group, which also reported a more negative sense of the depth of sleep and recovery after sleep. It was suggested that the underestimation of sleep time in insomnia patients was related to the proportion of slow wave sleep, reflecting sleep depth, rather than the objective total sleep time.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,*sleep time;*polysomnography;*insomnia;*patient;*human;*college;*psychopharmacology;sleep;slow wave sleep;drug therapy;hospital;medical record;mental disease;demography;university hospital;questionnaire;Polysomnography;Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders,,,,Mismatch of sleep time between subjective perception and objective findings from polysomnography in insomnia patients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies showed that participants with poor sleep quality presented week correlations between the two measurements. Since shortened sleep duration was also associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors in prior studies, an unbiased measurement of sleep duration is imperative. We explore the relationship between the two types of measurements among participants without obstructive sleep apnea. Method(s): The Chicago Area Sleep Study (CASS) recruited 585 participants aged 35-64 via commercially available telephone listings. Participants underwent 1 night of screening using in-home apnea detection equipment (ApneaLinkTM). Participants wore wrist actigraphs for 7 days (ActiwatchTM) to determine sleep duration. For data analysis, we include participants (n=474) with AHI<15 and subjectively and objectivelymeasured sleep duration between 4 and 14 hours. Self-reported sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index [PSQI]), health behaviors and cardiovascular disease risk factors were measured using standard protocols. Result(s): Mean self-reported sleep duration of 6hrs 49mins was signiicantly shorter than the mean objectively-measured sleep duration of 7hrs 6mins (mean [95% CI] of difference is -16.6min[-23.5, -9.8]). The two measures were modestly correlated (Pearson's rho = 0.37; p < 0.0001). Females showed slightly larger differences than males, -18.1 mins versus -14.4 mins, but not statistically signiicant. Difference was strongly associated with PSQI (beta = -12.4 min/PSQI, p < 0.0001) and age (beta = -1.5 min/year, p < 0.0004). Conclusion(s): The difference between objective and subjective sleep measurements was statistically signiicant, while their correlation was relatively small. The difference showed strong association with PSQI and age, indicating that older participants and those with higher PSQI tend to underreport their subjectively-measured sleep duration. The result of PSQI is consistent with results studying participants with poor sleep quality. Therefore, we need to carefully scrutinize the subjectivelymeasured sleep duration before carrying out further statistical analyses.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,*sleep;*organization;*United States;human;sleep time;Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index;sleep quality;cardiovascular disease;risk factor;data analysis;wrist;apnea;screening;night;telephone;statistical analysis;sleep disordered breathing;health behavior;male;female;Chicago,,,,Association between subjective and objective sleep measures: Chicago area sleep study,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While this is particularly seen in elderly and patients with insomnia, the discrepancy between subjective and objective sleep duration does exist in healthy subjects. Predictors of the discrepancy between subjective and objective sleep duration in healthy young adults are yet to be elucidated. This study aimed to examine the associations between mood on awakening and the subjective-objective discrepancy in sleep duration in healthy young adults using multilevel modeling approach. Method(s): Twenty-five healthy young adults (20.7 +/- 2.1 years; mean +/- SD) participated in the study over an eight-day period. The subjects wore a tri-axis accelerometer on the wrist throughout the study period and objective sleep duration and sleep efficiency were determined. The subjects also completed a daily questionnaire on awakening, which included questions about subjective sleep duration and sleep quality; depression and anxiety mood scale; and mood status or physical symptoms such as happiness, fatigue, sleepiness, stress, pain, anger, and lack of concentration. Multilevel modeling was used to examine the intra-individual associations between the subjective-objective discrepancy in sleep duration and subjective mood states on awakening. The discrepancy was calculated as the absolute magnitude of the difference between subjective and objective sleep duration. Result(s): The discrepancy between subjective and objective sleep durations was 42.7 +/- 31.2 min. Happy mood on awakening significantly predicted the discrepancy between subjective and objective sleep duration (p = 0.01); none of the other mood or physical symptoms significantly predicted the sleep discrepancy (p[0.05). On the other hand, the discrepancy in sleep duration did not significantly predict happy mood on awakening (p[0.05). Neither objective sleep efficiency nor subjective sleep quality significantly predicted the discrepancy in sleep duration (p[0.05). These results held true after controlling for age or gender. Conclusion(s): The mood of happiness could be a predictor of the discrepancy between subjective and objective measures of sleep duration, but not vice versa, in healthy young adults. This suggests that the specific mood status may underlie the cognitive processes concerning sleep misperception and thus could be a potential intervention target to normalize the sleep misperception. The results also have implications for epidemiologic studies examining the relationship between self-reported sleep duration and mortality and/or comorbidity.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,accelerometer;adult;aged;*anger;anxiety;clinical article;cognition;comorbidity;controlled study;fatigue;female;gender;*happiness;human;male;*mood;mortality;multilevel analysis;pain;questionnaire;sleep quality;*sleep time;somnolence;stress;wrist;young adult;conference abstract,,,,The mood of happiness on awakening predicts the discrepancy between subjective and objective sleep duration in healthy young adults,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Kita, Psychology Research Group-DEC, Bournemouth University, Bournemouth, United Kingdom","Introduction: Poor sleep in late pregnancy has been related to the development of postpartum depression (PPD), yet the speciic nature of this relationship remains unclear. One of the reasons for the lack of clarity may be due to the complex nature of sleep. Past research has found that subjective sleep is related to PPD, however these studies did not show the same relationship using actigraphy. This suggests that a discrepancy exists between subjective and objective sleep measures. This may be due to the use of actigraphy rather then polysomnography (PSG). In order to better understand the relationship between sleep and PPD, we irst need to understand the relationship between subjective and objective sleep. To the best of our knowledge this is the irst study to use PSG to compare subjective and objective sleep within a pregnant sample. Method(s): Women in their third trimester (n=23) underwent one night of PSG. The following morning a subjective sleep questionnaire was administered. These women were part of a larger study investigating the relationship between sleep and PPD. Result(s): Subjectively, women were relatively accurate at estimating their total sleep time (r=.59, p<.01); sleep onset latency (r=.66, p<.01), and number of awakenings (r=.61, p<.01). Subjective sleep quality was moderately correlated with objective number of awakenings (r=-.49, p=<.05) and percentage of time spent awake (r=-.44, p<.05), but was not signiicantly related to stages of sleep. However, subjective perception of sleep depth was correlated to percentage of time spent in stage one (r=-.42, p<.05). Conclusion(s): In contrast to previous research using actigraphy, this study shows moderate to strong correlations between women's subjective perceptions of sleep and objective PSG measures. One reason for this may be due to the relatively ine-grained analysis available with PSG. The implications of these indings for future research are discussed.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,*sleep;*organization;*third trimester pregnancy;female;human;actimetry;arousal;sleep time;questionnaire;polysomnography;sleep quality;night;latent period;puerperal depression;tuberculin;Pregnancy,,,,Subjective versus objective sleep in late pregnancy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Kyle, University of Glasgow Centre, Institute of Neuroscience and Psychology, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom","Introduction: Sleep Restriction Therapy (SRT) is considered an important component of CBT for insomnia. Despite this, little is known about its eficacy as a single therapy or how it exerts its therapeutic effect, in terms of objective sleep alterations or sleep-related cognitive arousal. Here we report preliminary indings from an ongoing study into the mechanisms underlying SRT response. Method(s): Nine patients (6 females; mean age = 46.4) with Psychophysiological Insomnia have thus far completed the SRT protocol. Patients initially sleep two nights in the lab to exclude sleep-related co-morbidities and to acquire baseline assessment of sleep. The intervention involves one main session to deliver SRT rationale/instructions, and 4 subsequent brief interactions to review sleep eficiency. During the irst 3 weeks of therapy, patients sleep 3 separate nights in the lab according to their prescribed sleep window. Home adherence to SRT was monitored with actigraphy and sleep diaries. Here we report within- subject changes (baseline to night 3) during in-lab SRT in relation to PSG-deined sleep continuity and architecture, self-report sleep and sleep-related cognitive arousal (assessed with the Glasgow Sleep Effort Scale [GSES], Pre-Sleep Arousal Scale [PSAS], and the Glasgow Content of Thoughts Inventory [GCTI]). Result(s): Self-reported SOL, WASO and sleep eficiency signiicantly improved from baseline to night 3 (all p<.05); there were no differences in TST. There were no signiicant improvements in objective sleep continuity or architecture, though there was a signiicant reduction in PSGdetermined TST by an average of 65 minutes from baseline (p<.001). A misperception index (MI) was also calculated, showing that misperception of sleep tended to decrease over SRT (MI=.22 at baseline vs .11 at night 3; p=.10). Both sleep effort (GSES; p<.05) and intrusive thoughts/ pre-sleep cognitive arousal signiicantly decreased (PSAS, GCTI; both p<.05), whereas there were no changes in pre-sleep somatic arousal through treatment. Conclusion(s): These preliminary indings indicate that while markers of subjective sleep, sleep-related cognitive arousal, and the perception of sleep may improve during the acute period of SRT implementation, PSG-deined sleep may not. The marked decrements in TST may relate to recent reports of side-effects in some patients during SRT. Given the small sample these indings are necessarily preliminary.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,*sleep;*organization;*diseases;*insomnia;*therapy;human;arousal;night;patient;architecture;actimetry;morbidity;self report;female;side effect;therapy effect;marker;Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders;Sleep,,,,Acute in-lab implementation of sleep restriction therapy for insomnia disorder: Impact on objective and subjective sleep,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lecci, Lausanne University Hospital, Lausanne, Switzerland","Objectives/Introduction: The impression of being awake despite polysomnographically documented sleep is sometimes observed in healthy individuals and to an extreme degree in patients with paradoxical insomnia. The mechanisms underlying the subjective perception of sleep are not well understood. Here we asked whether highdensity (hd)-EEG, a technique with a refined spatial resolution, could identify local patterns of brain activity related to the subjective perception of sleep. Method(s): 14 healthy subjects (age 33.6 +/- 8.5 years, 10 females) underwent a serial awakening paradigm in the sleep lab while recorded with hd-EEG (256 electrodes). 969 awakenings were performed across all sleep stages. At each awakening, subjects were asked to describe what was going through their mind and to estimate if immediately prior to the awakening they had been asleep or awake. Result(s): 10 of 14 subjects presented at least one instance in which they reported feeling awake (FAW) during sleep (15.92 +/- 8.76% times per subject, total of n = 99 times). 70.83% of FAW instances occurred in N1, 18.77% in N3, 9.79% in N2 and 3.57% in REM sleep. Only stages N2 and N3 were further considered for analysis. Compared to when subjects reported feeling asleep (FAS), FAW instances occurred earlier in the night (147 +/- 79 min after lights off vs 231 +/- 25 min; p = 0.0038). The presence of conscious experiences during sleep did not distinguish FAW from FAS, but experiences associated with FAW tended to be more thought-like and less perceptual compared to FAS (Score: 0.52 +/- 1.17 for FAS; -1.00 +/- 1.84 for FAW; p = 0.076). FAW was associated with increased alpha (8-12 Hz) and sigma power (12-16 Hz) in central and posterior brain regions in the 20 s before the awakening. No significant differences were observed for other frequency bands. Conclusion(s): The preferential occurrence of FAW early in the night (N3 > N2), its quasi-absence during REM sleep and its association with increased alpha power in posterior (sensory) brain regions may indicate that the subjective perception of sleep depends on the degree of sleep-related environmental disconnection.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,adult;arousal;brain region;controlled study;electrode;*electroencephalogram;female;human;human experiment;light;major clinical study;*perception;*REM sleep;*wakefulness;conference abstract;Emotions;Electroencephalography,,,,Feeling awake while asleep: A highdensity EEG assessment of sleep perception,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study evaluated the difference between the objective total sleep time (TST) and the subjective TST obtained from nocturnal polysomnography (NPSG) and sleep questionnaires completed by patients diagnosed with primary insomnia or obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSA). Method(s): The subjects were 311 consecutive patients who were referred to the Center for Sleep and Chronobiology at the Seoul National University Hospital during 2007-2008 and were finally diagnosed with NPSG as primary insomnia or OSA. They were also asked to complete two questionnaires: Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) including TST of recent 1 month (TSTPSQI) and a Morning Questionnaire administered on the morning right after NPSG about the subjective TST during NPSG (TSTMQ). ANOVA (with post hoc Tukey B test) and Pearson correlation (each with significance level of p<0.05) were used for analyses. Result(s): Among the 311 subjects, 77 were diagnosed with primary insomnia (40 males, 37 females) and 234 were diagnosed with OSA (198 males, 36 females). In both diagnostic groups, TSTNPSG, TSTPSQI and TSTMQ significantly differed (primary insomnia: 388.6+68.8 min vs. 297.1+101.9 min vs. 272.0+113.0 min, F=31.3, df=2, p<0.01) (OSA: 411.8+56.4 min vs. 374.0+83.3 min vs. 369.0+107.4 min, F=18.0, df=2, p<0.01). Tukey B test revealed that TSTNPSG differed significantly either from TSTPSQI or from TSTMQ in both diagnostic groups (p<0.05, respectively). Differences of TSTNPSG and TSTPSQI between primary insomnia and OSA (91.5+/-117.3 min vs. 37.8+/-99.5 min, respectfully) and of TST- NPSG and TSTMQ between primary insomnia and OSA (116.7+/-117.5 min vs. 43.2+/-100.1 min, respectfully) were all significant (t=3.9, p<0.01; t=5.3, p<0.01, respectfully). Differences between TSTNPSG and TSTPSQI and between TSTNPSG and TSTMQ were positively correlated with PSQI total scores in both diagnostic groups (primary insomnia: r=0.62, p<0.01 and r=0.29, p<0.01, respectfully) (OSA: r=0.42, p<0.01 and r=0.25, p<0.01, respectfully). Conclusion(s): The subjective TST was shorter than the objective TST not only in patients with primary insomnia but also in patients with OSA. The differences were significantly higher in primary insomnia than in OSA, probably reflecting additional psychological factor. We also noted that the difference between the objective and the subjective TSTs increases, as the subjective sleep quality gets poorer.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,*insomnia;*sleep;*patient;*sleep time;*health care organization;diagnosis related group;questionnaire;female;male;sleep disorder;polysomnography;sleep apnea syndrome;chronobiology;university hospital;psychological aspect;analysis of variance;Sleep;Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders,,,,Objective total sleep time is longer than subjective total sleep time in those patients with primary insomnia and obstructive sleep apneasyndrome,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study assesses night-to-night variability in, and the association between, subjective and objectivelyrecorded sleep patterns. Method(s): Twenty patients with chronic insomnia completed a sleep diary each morning after completing a two-night, in-home study with Sleep ProilerTM (Advanced Brain Monitoring, Carlsbad, CA). This cohort included ten patients with comorbid OSA; eight were studied in-home while on CPAP. Sleep diary responses provided measures of lights out to lights on, sleep-time, sleep-eficiency, sleep-onset, and wake-aftersleep-onset (WASO). The associated objective measures were derived from manual editing of software enabled automated sleep staging. Pearson correlations and Bland-Altman plots were used to assess within-and across-night associations among the sleep measures. Result(s): There was moderate between-night agreement in objective sleep-time (r = 0.56; p < 0.01). The concordance between the objective and subjective sleep-time improved on night-two (r = 0.81; p < 0.00001), as compared to night-one (r = 0.46; p > 0.05). There was substantially less night-to-night variability in objective sleep-eficiency (r = 0.82; p < 0.00001), as compared to self-reported sleep-eficiency (r = 0.48; p < 0.05). The night-to-night agreement in sleep-onset was stronger when detected electro-physiologically (r = 0.74; p < 0.001), as compared to the self-report (r = 0.47; p < 0.05). The agreement between objective and subjective reports of sleep-onset were stronger on nighttwo (r = 0.84; p < 0.00001) vs. night-one. (r = 0.50; p < 0.05). Strong night-to-night consistency was observed for both objective WASO (r = 0.68; p < .001) and subjective WASO (r = 0.73; p < 0.001). There was no relationship between objective and subjective WASO for nights-one or night-two. Both objective and subjective measures of SE and SO were bias toward improved sleep quality on night 2. Conclusion(s): Objective measures of sleep-time, sleep eficiency, and sleep-onset report less night-to-night variability as compared to sleep diaries.

We compared measurement of adolescent sleep duration using estimation (self-report), calculation (self-report), and actigraphy (objective), and determined which self-report method most closely reflects the objective measurement of sleep. Method(s): Healthy adolescents (n = 46) ages 11-15 years completed two stays in the sleep laboratory as part of a within-subjects crossover study. Participants wore wrist actigraphs before and between the two laboratory stays. Actigraphy-based average sleep duration was calculated for each participant who had at least 4 days of actigraphy data. During the laboratory stay, participants completed a self-report of 'usual' sleep, from which we derived a self-report estimate of usual sleep duration, and a calculation of usual sleep duration based on the actual sleep onset and offset times and minutes awake that participants reported. We utilized linear mixed models to examine differences in sleep duration among the three methods. Result(s): Participant average sleep duration was estimated at 9:05h (S.D. = 2:07h) and was calculated at 9:43h (S.D. = 1:24h), while actigraphy showed an average sleep duration of 7:17h (S.D. = 00:49h). We observed a main effect of measurement method (F = 54.16, df = 44.20, p < 0.001) such that participants overestimated sleep duration using the estimation method (1:48h difference, df = 37.11, p < 0.001) and using the calculation method (2:26h difference, df = 46.93, p < 0.001) as compared to actigraphy. The two self-reports of sleep duration did not differ significantly from each other (00:37h difference, df = 45.35, p < 0.118). Conclusion(s): Our findings confirm that self-report measures of usual sleep duration do not accurately reflect actigraphy-determined sleep duration, whether based on habitual summary measures, or measures of sleep duration calculated from more specific sleep variables. Insufficient sleep may be an even larger problem in adolescents than originally thought, if these results generalize to nor mative samples collected in epidemiological studies.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,*sleep;*sleep time;*human;*actimetry;*adolescent;*organization;self report;laboratory;crossover procedure;model;wrist;recall bias;Adolescent,,,,Estimating 'usual' sleep duration among adolescents: Comparison of multiple selfreport measures and actigraphy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For the irst night effects (FNE), the previous studies mainly focused on the differences in sleep architectures between irst and second nights in insomnia. We examined FNE on both subjective and objective sleep in insomnia through the current multicenter study. Method(s): We collected data in 125 patients with primary insomnia (51.4 +/- 10.4 years old, 38 males) according to the diagnostic criteria in DSMIV at ive hospitals. Patients underwent two consecutive nights of polysomnography (PSG), and subjective sleep was evaluated via a morning questionnaire following overnight PSG recording. Sleep perception was calculated as subjective sleep time/objective sleep time*100%. Result(s): For sleep architecture in the second night compared to the irst night, the patients had increases in total sleep time and N3 time, and decreases in N1 time, rapid eye movement (REM) time, time of wakefulness after sleep onset, sleep latency, latency to REM (p < 0.05). For subjective sleep evaluation, in the second night compared to the irst night, an increase was obtained in total sleep time (185 +/- 116 vs. 229 +/- 109 min, p < 0.001), but no changes in sleep latency, number and time of wakefulness after sleep onset. A trend of increase in sleep perception was seen in the second night compared to irst night (60 +/- 48% vs. 67 +/- 33%), but it did not reach at signiicant level (p = 0.107). Conclusion(s): Through this multicenter study, we found that the signiicant FNE can be seen in both objectively and subjectively evaluated sleep in the patients with primary insomnia.

Therefore, our goal was to measure if sleep misperception correlates with insomnia severity and how individuals with different levels of insomnia would perceive their sleep compared to those without insomnia. Method(s): A total of 1042 individuals (mean age 42.34+/-14.39, 55.6% women) representing the adult population of Sao Paulo city, Brazil, were interviewed. They underwent a full-night polysomnography (PSG) registered at the sleep laboratory and answered the Insomnia Severity Index(ISI).The sleep perception index was determined by the ratio between the perceived amount of sleep on the morning following PSG and the total sleep time registered objectively through the night. Individuals with an index below the percentile 25 were categorized as underestimating sleep. The ISI score classiied individuals as having non-clinical insomnia (0-7), subthreshold insomnia (8-14) and moderate-to-severe insomnia (15-28). Result(s): The mean sleep perception index for the total sample was 1.03+/-0.34. The mean ISI was 7.89+/-6.08. A modest but signiicant negative correlation was found between both indexes (r= -0.13; p<0.001). The mean sleep perception decreased with increasing levels of insomnia severity (1.05+/-0.38, 1.02+/-0.28 and 0.96+/-0.28; p=0.01). The frequency of individuals underestimating sleep was accordingly higher as insomnia severity levels increased (19.5%, 21.9% and 33.3%; p=0.004).

Lynam, Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, Buffalo, NY, United States","Objective: Increased physical activity (PA) improves the immune system and anticancer responses, while inactivity is associated with higher mortality in ovarian cancer. PA is a modifiable risk factor; however, studies of PA in cancer patients rely on patient-reported questionnaires without objective measures. In this pilot study, our objective was to obtain real-time data using a Fitbit activity-tracking device to measure PA and sleep in patients with ovarian and endometrial cancer and compare these data to patients' self-reported PA, sleep, and quality of life. Method(s): Patients with endometrial or ovarian cancer and ECOG 0-1 were recruited at time of diagnosis or recurrence before initiation of subsequent therapy. Enrollees were given a Fitbit Charge2 device for a 9-month study period and advised to wear the device at least 5 days per week. Demographic variables, anthropomorphic measurements, activity data, and sleep patterns were obtained. Quality-of-life (QOL) assessments using EORTC questionnaires, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaires (GLTEQ) were conducted every 3 months and correlated to Fitbit data. Result(s): There were 27 evaluable patients with a mean age of 58.7 +/- 10.3 years. Mean BMI was 31.9 +/- 8.6 kg/m2. Patient compliance with device use was 85.2%, and activity was classified using American College of Sports Medicine criteria. Biometric data from Fitbit devices demonstrated a median daily step count of 1,309.8 (range 6.3-26,408.3) with 5.61 hours of sleep per night (range 2.1-7.7 hours). Average self-reported PA was at least moderate for 76.2% of patients with an average GLTEQ score of 28.1 +/- 5.23, in sharp contrast to Fitbit data demonstrating sedentary activity in most patients (85.2%, n = 23). Poor quality of sleep was reported by 55.6%; however, only 7.4% of patients averaged a recommended 7+ hours of sleep.

Conclusion(s): Objectively recorded PA and sleep time show most of our patients live a sedentary lifestyle with inadequate sleep, and overreport PA and sleep time.

Lynch, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Department of Psychology, Birmingham, AL, United States","Introduction: This preliminary study examined the sleep patterns and problems of children with Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE) compared to healthy peers. EoE is a chronic inflammatory gastrointestinal disorder with symptoms of upper gastrointestinal distress and increased eosinophils in the esophagus. Research has illustrated the negative impact EoE has on the child's quality of life (QOL). Sleep is an important, yet to be examined, factor that may impact the QOL of children with EoE. Method(s): Fourteen children with EoE and 12 healthy children ages 4-12 years participated. Parents completed the Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaires (CSQH), a QOL questionnaire, and a sleep diary for their child. The child wore an actigraph watch for 12 days for objective report on sleep. Result(s): Based on on actigraphy, an objective measure, sleep efficiency of children with EoE (80.2%) was significantly poorer than the healthy children (87%; t(1) = -2.294, p < 0.05. However, children's scores on the CSQH, by parent report, were equivalent across groups with no significant differences on subscales or total scores. Parents reported children with EoE had poorer QOL than healthy peers (t(1) = -3.042, p<0.05). Conclusion(s): Objective reports of sleep in children with EoE provide evidence of significantly poor sleep compared to healthy controls which may be under-reported or unrecognized. Subjective reports via caregivers were incongruent with actigraph data, indicating limited awareness of the nighttime problems. The child may not alert the parent to sleep problems, or the focus of attention with EoE in families may be on the quality of life daytime changes rather than the nighttime problems. Assessment of sleep problems and daytime consequences that may indicate sleep problem is needed.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,*sleep;*eosinophilic esophagitis;*human;*organization;*child;parent;quality of life;questionnaire;gastrointestinal symptom;gastrointestinal disease;caregiver;actimetry;sleep pattern;habit;esophagus;eosinophil;Only Child;Child,,,,Objective and subjective report of sleep problems in children with Eosinophilic Esophagitis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Polysomnography is impractical for long-term sleep studies and results may not be representative of sleep in normal environment. Many researchers have turned to alternative, cost-effective methods such as daily sleep diaries and actigraphy, yet these methods also have drawbacks. Method(s): This secondary analysis of a randomized trial examines the discrepancy between sleep diary and actigraphic measures in breast cancer survivors and whether these discrepancies varied according to participant characteristics. Forty-three women with persistent insomnia after breast cancer treatment (average age = 51.86) were randomized to either cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTI) or attention controlled behavioral placebo (desensitization). Women completed a daily sleep diary and wore an actigraphy wrist watch during their 6-week intervention. Result(s): Actigraphic and diary measurements of total sleep time (TST) and wake after sleep onset (WASO) were collected during a pilot study testing the effect of CBTI on sleep and functioning. Women provided age, cancer stage, education, and sleep medication use data and completed the Piper Fatigue Score, Insomnia Severity Index, and Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale. Findings suggest poor agreement between actigraphic and sleep diary measurements of TST and WASO. On average, actigraphy measured less TST and more WASO than diaries. The discrepancies were highly variable both between and within subjects. Although a few women had relatively good agreement and showed similar trends in the measures over time, others showed a high lack of agreement. This variability in agreement could not be explained by characteristics such as age, cancer stage, education, sleep aid use, fatigue, insomnia severity or mood.

Polysomnography is impractical for many study participants and results may not be representative of sleep in normal environment. Given the possible limitation of actigraphy in populations with significant sleep difficulties, the association between actigraphy and other sleep assessment tools has been an area of interest in Veterans with mental health and medical conditions. The objective was to examine the discrepancy between sleep diary and actrigraphic measures of sleep in Veterans with moderate-severe post-acute TBI and to explore whether these discrepancies vary according to participant characteristics. Method(s): Nineteen male Veterans with post-acute moderate/severe TBI and insomnia symptoms as measured by the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) were recruited from VA Medical Center in the Rocky Mountain US. Veterans completed a daily sleep diary, Ohio State University TBI-Identification Method, ISI, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and wore an actigraphy watch for one week. Actigraphic and diary measurements of total sleep time (TST), wake after sleep onset (WASO), and sleep latency (SL) were calculated. Result(s): Bland-Altman plots were used to assess agreement between the measures. Findings suggest poor agreement between actigraphy and sleep diary measurements of TST, WASO, and SL. On average, actigraphy measured greater duration of all three sleep parameters. Discrepancies were not found to be associated with specific TBI characteristics or mood-related symptoms.

McGrath, Pediatric Public Health Psychology Laboratory, Concordia University, Montreal, Canada","Introduction: While polysomnography is the established gold standard, technological advances have enabled more resource efficient (cost, time, user-ease) assessment of select sleep dimensions and patterns. Wrist actigraphy is an ambulatory wearable increasingly used in research and clinical settings as it permits unobtrusive measurement of sleep in one's home environment. Previous research analyzed accelerometry data to yield validated algorithms (e.g., Sadeh, Cole) to distinguish sleep/wake epochs. Within the pediatric literature, Meltzer and colleagues (2011, 2015) comprehensively compared timing rules for immobility minutes and sensitivity thresholds to define sleep onset. These technical specifications rely on accurate identification of the ""lights-out"" rest interval, withinwhich algorithmsare applied to derive sleep parameters. Fewstudies state howthe rest interval was defined; fewer explicitly report using sleep diaries, event markers, light intensity, visual inspection with manual scoring, or default software settings. A related challenge is the contemporary meaning of ""lights-out"" given the ubiquitous use of electronic gadgets in the bedroomwhile falling asleep. The aim of the present study was to compare three scoring protocols to define the rest interval for actigraphy among children and adolescents. Material(s) and Method(s): Children and adolescents (Mage = 13.7 years; N = 76; 41.2% girls) participated in the larger Healthy Heart Project at Concordia University, Quebec. Youth wore a wrist actigraphy (piezoelectric accelerometer; Actiwatch2, Philips Respironics) on their non-dominant arm continuously for two weeks. Three scoring protocols were used to define the start and end time of the rest interval in Actiware software: (1) Parent and youth report (rest interval defined as bedtime and waketime for school night or weekend from Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire); (2) Sleep log (varied nightly to correspond with adapted Consensus Sleep Diary; ""What time did you close your eyes and try to go to sleep""); and (3) Manual scoring (varied nightly according to standardized rules for combinations of activity, light, event marker; rater reliability = .96). Result(s): Intraclass correlation coefficients were used to evaluate correspondence of the scoring protocols. Manual scoring yielded the highest correspondence with the sleep log for rest interval start (ICC = .79), end (ICC = .93), and duration (ICC = .80). Compared to parent reported times, children had better correspondence with manual scoring and sleep log (ICC = .49 vs .59). Both parents and children overestimated the time spent sleeping, reporting bedtimes nearly 1 hour earlier than manual scoring and sleep log. Waketime was also misestimated; children slept-in or snoozed almost 30 minutes longer than reported. Changing the timing of the rest interval consequently yielded longer onset latency, lower efficiency, more wake bouts, and greater fragmentation based on child and parent reported times, compared to manual scoring and sleep log. Conclusion(s): Results underscore the importance of accurately defining the rest interval. Consistent with previous recommendations, the sleep log was an essential supplement for actigraphy scoring. Parent and child report of typical bedtime was non-optimal for defining the rest interval, and could yield inaccurate sleep dimension parameters, especially latency and efficiency. Future researchers should consider how to precisely capture the intention of ""lights-out"".","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,accelerometer;*actimetry;adolescent;child;consensus;correlation coefficient;eye;female;girl;habit;heart;human;immobility;light intensity;major clinical study;night;Quebec;questionnaire;reliability;*rest;scientist;*sleep parameters;software;wrist;writing;conference abstract;Sleep,,,,Comparison of actigraphy scoring protocols to define the rest interval and optimally derive pediatric sleep dimensions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The group with chronic sleep reduction (N = 55) constitutes adolescents who scored 1 standard deviation above the mean on the Chronic Sleep Reduction Questionnaire (CSRQ) (Meijer, 2008; Dewald 2012). Adolescents with insomnia (N = 160) were referred for an insomnia treatment. All data were collected daily during one regular school week. Sleep was measured with actigraphy and sleep logs. Result(s): Linear Mixed Model analyses showed that adolescents with chronic sleep reduction and insomnia differed from healthy sleeping adolescents on SS, WUT, TIB, SOL, and SE. However, except for SOL, this effect concerned the weekends. When the sleep reduction group was compared with the insomnia group, scores for SOL and WASO were higher and SE lower for the insomnia group. Interestingly, adolescents with chronic sleep reduction showed a discrepancy between actigraphy and sleep log data for TIB and adolescents with insomnia for SOL.

This is partly due to present electroencephalography (EEG) electrodes being too cumbersome for patient's self-application. A trained sleep technician must apply the electrodes, and this fact limits thewider utilization of H-PSG. We have recently introduced a screen-printed ambulatory electrode set (AES), and shown its accuracy in sleep staging [1], and in detection of sleep bruxism events [2]. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that a newly designed AES is simple enough for patient self-application and it enables reliable acquisition of in-home sleep data. Material(s) and Method(s): Sixty-two self-administrated H-PSG recordings with a newly designed AES were performed in volunteer subjects (aged 39.6+/-11.6 years, 86% females) with self-reported sleep bruxism. The recording montage consisted of four EEG derivations (Fp1-T10, Fp2-T9, Af8-T9, Af7-T10), two electrooculography (EOG) derivations (F7-T10, F8- T9), two submental electromyography (EMG) derivations, two bipolar masseter EMG derivations and single electrocardiography channel (modified lead II). Skin-electrode contact impedances were continuously recorded by the ambulatory PSG device (Nox A1, Nox Medical). Technical quality of the recordings was graded based on the proportions of interpretable data. All subjects filled in a questionnaire including questions concerning subjective quality of sleep and ease of applying the AES. Result(s): Out of the sixty-two sleep studies conducted, the quality of fiftyseven recordings (91.9%) was graded good or better, and three recordings (4.8%) were considered as failed. Electrical characteristics of hydrogelcoated silver ink electrodes were found adequate for clinical sleep recordings and skin-electrode impedances generally remained stable and low enough in overnight recordings. The most common artifact present in EEG and EOG channels was low frequency (< 1 Hz) activity (""sweat artifact"") but this was found to be partly manageable by using digital highpass filtering. AES was considered as easy to apply by participants (easiness for EEG and EOG: 3.6+/-2.2 (mean+/-SD) and for chin EMG: 2.1+/-1.4; scale from 1 = easy to 10 = difficult). Only one recording (1.6%) failed due to mistakes in AES appliance. Good subjective sleep quality was in concordance with determined sleep parameters, such as high sleep efficiency (90.6+/-6.9%). Conclusion(s): AES was found to be a simple and less disturbing tool for portable sleep monitoring. Reliability of AES recordings was comparable to that previously reported for conventional unattended H-PSG that includes EEG electrodes applied by a technician. Self-applicable AES has a great potential to become a reliable tool for H-PSG.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,adult;artifact;*chin;electrocardiography;electroencephalography;electromyography;electrooculography;error;female;filtration;human;impedance;male;monitoring;polysomnography;questionnaire;reliability;*skin electrode;sleep bruxism;*sleep quality;staging;sweat;volunteer;silver;conference abstract,,,,At-home quantification of sleep characteristics with selfapplicable facial electrode set,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This may have important implications for the ability to detect and prevent adverse outcomes of sleep disturbance in older adults. Method(s): We used data on 5,710 older adults from the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures and the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men Sleep Study to evaluate the prevalence of subjective and objective sleep disturbance. Subjective sleep disturbance was assessed by selfreport using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and defined as sleep onset latency (SOL) >30 minutes, total sleep time (TST) <6 hours, or sleep efficiency (SE) <75%. Objective sleep disturbance was assessed by actigraphy and defined as SOL >30 minutes, TST <6 hours, or SE <75%. We used Cramer's phi coefficient to examine agreement between objective and subjective sleep measures. We used multivariable- adjusted logistic regression to identify correlates (age, sex, cognitive impairment [3MS<=82 in men; MMSE <24 in women]) of congruence in subjective and objective measures of sleep disturbance. Result(s): The mean (SD) for age was 80.1 (5.8) years; 52% were female. Prevalences of subjective and objective sleep disturbance were 30.8% and 73.8%, respectively; the resulting correlation between these two measures was weak (phic=0.13). Sixty-six percent of older adults with objective sleep disturbance did not report subjective sleep disturbance. In adjusted analyses, these participants were more likely to be male (OR=1.98, 95%CI=1.66-2.34) and were less likely to have depressive symptoms (OR=0.41, 95%CI=0.33-0.51), when compared to participants who had both objective and subjective sleep disturbance. There was no difference in age or prevalence of cognitive impairment between these groups. Conclusion(s): Subjective and objective sleep measures correlate poorly in older adults, and a large proportion have objective but not subjective sleep disturbance. These participants were more likely to be men and less likely to report depressive symptoms.

Method(s): Using data on 5,717 older persons from the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures and the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men Sleep Study, we calculated the prevalence of self-reported and actigraphic SSD with and without poor sleep quality, respectively. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) evaluated self-reported sleep duration and poor sleep quality (PSQI score >5), whereas results from wrist actigraphy were averaged over approximately 5 days. Next, we examined the agreement between self-reported and actigraphic SSD and the correlates associated with discordance, using multivariate logistic regression. Correlates included age, sex, race, poor sleep quality, and impairments in cognition (MMSE <24 in women; Teng 3MS <82 in men) and physical function (inability to do a chair stand). Result(s): Mean age was 80 years (SD 5.8); 50% were female and 90% were white. Self-reported and actigraphic SSD were established in 767 (13.4%) and 1,617 (28.3%) participants, respectively.

Result(s): Mean age was 80 years (SD 5.8); 50% were female and 10% were African-American. Self-reported and actigraphic LS were established in 453 (7.9%) and 128 (2.2%) participants, respectively. Among those with self-reported LS, 93 (20.5%) also had poor sleep quality. Among those with actigraphic LS, 68 (53.1%) also had poor sleep quality. The correlation between self-reported and actigraphic sleep duration was poor (k=0.10). The odds of discordance in sleep duration were higher with older age (1.05 [1.02, 1.07]) and impaired cognition (2.03 [1.42, 2.90]) and physical function (1.77 [1.36, 2.31]). Conclusion(s): In older persons, our results suggest a poor correlation between self-reported and actigraphic sleep duration, most evident with older age and impaired cognition and physical function. Thus, in older persons, the epidemiologic evaluation of LS with or without poor sleep quality, including associations with subsequent adverse health outcomes, should include actigraphy-measured sleep duration.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,actimetry;adverse outcome;African American;aged;cognition;controlled study;female;fragility fracture;human;major clinical study;male;Mini Mental State Examination;outcome assessment;Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index;prevalence;sleep quality;*sleep time;very elderly;wrist;conference abstract,,,,Self-reported and actigraphic long sleep duration in older persons,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies found increased physiological activation in this condition. This study aimed to investigate sleep characteristics and nocturnal cardiovascular parameters among healthy subjects not complaining of sleep disorders, with either low or high accuracy in their sleep duration perception. Method(s): We studied 21 healthy subjects (14 women; mean age = 45.0 +/- 8.9 years). Heart rate (HR) and non invasive beat-to-beat blood pressure (BP) were continuously recorded during one night of polysomnography. Subjects were free of any medical, psychiatric or sleep disorders and weren't on any medication. Subjects were divided in 2 groups: (1) high accuracy group: difference between objective (polysomnographic) and subjective sleep duration < 30 min, mean difference = )8.6 +/- 18.2, n = 9; (2) low accuracy group: underestimation greater than 30 min, mean difference = 73.6 +/- 34.0, n = 12. Between-group differences were assessed with t-tests. Result(s): The 2 groups were similar in age, body mass index and objective sleep measures, i.e. sleep latency, sleep efficiency, total sleep time, number of awakenings and micro-arousals index. Mean HR during the night was also similar. However, the low accuracy group had higher mean nocturnal systolic BP (111.7 +/- 11.5 versus 100.3 +/- 11.9 mmHg, P= 0.04) and diastolic BP (62.6 +/- 8.6 versus 55.4 +/- 4.7 mmHg, P= 0.04) compared to the high accuracy group. Conclusion(s): This study shows that healthy subjects underestimating their sleep duration have higher nocturnal BP. These results support studies reporting increased physiological activation in inaccurate sleep perception and emphasize the link between paradoxical insomnia and hyperarousal.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,*sleep;*normal human;*society;*blood pressure;sleep disorder;insomnia;arousal;night;heart rate;polysomnography;drug therapy;Student t test;body mass;sleep time;patient;cardiovascular parameters;female,,,,Higher nocturnal blood pressure in healthy subjects underestimating their sleep duration,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most, Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience, Amsterdam, Netherlands","Sleep in old age is lighter, shorter, and more fragmented than in young. In Alzheimer's disease (AD) these characteristics become more pronounced. A disturbed rest-activity rhythm in severe dementia may contribute to the risk of institutionalization. Alterations in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) probably contribute to this disturbance, especially in AD. An early determination of minor sleep disturbances opens for a prompt start of countermeasures, postponing the development of severe sleep syndromes; not only increasing patients' quality of live and ease caregiver burden, but also delaying institutionalization. It thus seems to be valuable to screen for disturbed sleep as a standard procedure in outpatient memory clinics. Commonly, patients are queried about their subjective perception of sleep. However, subjective measures are known to diverge with objective sleep measures, even in healthy subjects. The aim of the present study was to examine whether subjective sleep reports in early stage AD patients and healthy controls differ in their relationships with objectively estimated sleep parameters obtained from actigraphy. Participants were AD patients (37 male/15 female, 70.4 +/- 3.2 years old, disease duration: 1.07 +/- 1.11 years) and healthy age matched controls (15 male/9 female, 67.2 +/- 7.7 years old). All subjects wore an actiwatch for 2 weeks to estimate objective sleep. A pressure pad placed on the mattress and connected to a logger with integrated light sensor was used to record bed times and lights out times. Questionnaires used to obtain subjective measures were the Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS), the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Inventory (PSQI) and the Sleep Disorders Questionnaire (SDQ). Spearman's correlations were calculated between parameters and independent sample t-tests were used to compare the two groups. Preliminary data show that AD are more awake during the night than controls, with more wake after bedtime (P = 0.01) and more fragmentation (P = 0.00), yet scored lower on the AIS (P = 0.02) and the SDQ insomnia subscale (P = 0.04). In the control group, the AIS score correlated with actigraphic estimates of sleep duration (rho = ).42, P = 0.04) and wake after bedtime (rho = ).46, P = 0.02). In AD, the SDQ insomnia subscale correlated with wake after bedtime (rho = .31, P = 0.02), total sleep duration (rho = ).28,P = 0.05) and the average duration of uninterrupted sleep bouts (rho = ).29, P = 0.04). Aged, healthy controls do not report their objective sleep coherently. Most importantly however, our investigations conclude that sleep is already affected shortly after the diagnosis AD is first made, but that patient reports do not capture this. In fact, AD patients consistently underestimated their sleep. Consequently, sleep problems in AD patients may remain hidden and untreated, preventing any necessary treatment and increasing the risk of developing severe sleep disruptions.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,*sleep;*patient;*society;insomnia;questionnaire;institutionalization;sleep disorder;risk;female;diagnosis;senescence;rhythm;dementia;suprachiasmatic nucleus;caregiver burden;outpatient;Alzheimer disease;hospital;normal human;sleep parameters;actimetry;disease duration;sensor;Student t test;night;control group;memory;phosphorus 31,,,,Subjective sleep reports in early-stage Alzheimer's patients fail to detect their compromised sleep,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Limited objective data exist on the average sleep duration and stability of sleep patterns of New Zealand children. This pilot study aimed to collect normative data on children's sleep across school and non-school nights. Method(s): Actigraphy and sleep diaries were used over seven consecutive days and nights with 52 children, aged 6-8-years, living in the Wellington region. Parentally-completed questionnaires, incorporating the Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ), captured information on children's typical sleep behaviour. Result(s): Average actigraphically measured sleep duration was 9.9 hours (SD = 0.5) on school nights and 9.5 hours (SD = 0.7) on non-school nights. On school nights, children went to bed significantly earlier (school night: M = 20:19 vs. non-school night: M = 20:42, t(50) = -4.49, p <.001), and started sleeping significantly earlier (school night: M = 20:43 vs. non-school night: M = 21:10, t(50) = -5.74, p <.001). No significant difference was found in the time that children woke up on school and non-school mornings (school morning: M = 06:35 vs. non-school morning: M = 06:41, t(50) = -1.34, p =.185). Sleep efficiency did not differ significantly across the week (school night: 88.1% vs. non-school night: 88.3%, z = -1.14, p =.253). Compared with actigraphy, parental report of children's usual sleep on week nights and weekends over-estimated children's sleep (week nights: M = 10.5, t(48) = -6.62, p <.001; weekends: Mdn = 10.5, z = -5.16, p <.001). Discussion(s): Results of this within-subjects design study showed stable objectively measured sleep patterns. Parents generally over-estimated the amount of sleep children had, compared with actigraphy.

Mundt, Clinical and Health Psychology, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, United States","Introduction: In insomnia, actigraphy tends to underestimate wake time compared to diaries and PSG. When chronic pain co-occurs with insomnia, sleep may be more fragmented, including more arousals accompanied by movement. However, individuals may not be consciously aware of these arousals. We therefore hypothesized that in comorbid in-somnia/fibromyalgia, actigraphy and PSG would be relatively concordant, while actigraphy would overestimate WASO and underestimate TST and SE compared to diaries. Accordingly, we expected actigraphy to be less sensitive than diaries to detecting treatment-related changes following cognitive behavioral treatment for insomnia (CBT-I). Method(s): Adults with insomnia and fibromyalgia (N = 113) were randomized to waitlist control, CBT-I, or CBT for pain. At baseline and post-treatment, participants completed 1 night of PSG and 2 weeks of diaries/actigraphy. Result(s): We examined baseline concordance and treatment-related changes in TIB, TST, SOL, WASO, and SE. At baseline, ANOVAs showed that the discrepancy between actigraphy/PSG was significantly less (p < 0.05) than the difference between actigraphy/diary. As expected, the difference in concordance was significant for TST, WASO, SE. Repeated measures ANOVAs were performed for the CBT-I group, and significant method by time interactions indicated that the assessment methods differed in their sensitivity to detect treatment-related changes. Post-hoc analyses showed that PSG values did not change significantly for any sleep parameters. However, diaries showed improvements in SOL, WASO, and SE, and actigraphy also detected the WASO and SE improvements (ps < 0.05). Conclusion(s): In the context of comorbid insomnia/fibromyalgia, actigraphy is generally more concordant with PSG than it is with diaries, which are the recommended assessment for diagnosing insomnia. However, actigraphy showed greater sensitivity to treatment-related changes than PSG; PSG failed to detect any improvements, but actigraphy demonstrated changes in WASO and SE, which were also found with diaries. In comorbid insomnia/fibromyalgia, actigraphy may therefore have utility in measuring treatment outcomes.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,*sleep;*insomnia;*fibromyalgia;*treatment outcome;*organization;actimetry;arousal;cognitive therapy;human;adult;sleep parameters;post hoc analysis;night;pain;chronic pain;Comorbidity;Fibromyalgia;Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders,,,,Measuring treatment outcomes in comorbid insomnia and fibromyalgia: Concordance of subjective and objective assessments,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Najm, University of Houston, Houston, TX, United States","Introduction: Sleep state misperception (SSM) is characterized by an inaccurate perception of one's sleep as alertness and is frequently experienced by individuals with insomnia. Inaccurate beliefs of inadequate sleep elicit arousal and worry, further perpetuating insufficient sleep (Harvey, 2002). Up to 90% of children with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) report problems sleeping, but SSM has not been explored in this population. Method(s): Eighty-four children (44 females; Mage = 8.80, SD-age = 1.40) with either primary GAD (n = 44) or no diagnosis (n = 40) were studied across seven consecutive nights of actigraphy and self-reports of sleep onset latency (SOL), reported in minutes. Discrepancy between the measures was calculated using a difference score (self-report SOL - actigraphy SOL). Result(s): Multilevel models using full maximum likelihood estimation were used. At level 1, we predicted the SOL indicator (actigraphy, self-report, or the discrepancy score) by an intercept. At level 2, we used group as a predictor of the intercept. Group only marginally predicted objective SOL (Intercept = 20.84, Beta = 5.18, SE = 2.74, p = 0.06) with GAD children evidencing slightly longer SOL (M = 26.08, SD = 13.43) than control children (M = 20.82, SD = 10.93). GAD children reported significantly longer SOL (M = 27.38, SD = 22.91) than control children (M = 14.89, SD = 10.15; Intercept = 14.95, Beta = 12.43, SE = 3.86, p = 0.002). Children with GAD were more likely to over-report SOL (Intercept = -5.87, Beta = 6.79, SE = 3.27, p = 0.04). Conclusion(s): Results suggest that GAD children estimate significantly longer sleep initiation than they actually experience. On average, anxious youth only require about 6 minutes longer than controls to fall asleep. Future research is needed to explore the nature of SSM in this group including possible differences in EEG arousal based on spectral analyses.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,*sleep;*anxiety disorder;*human;*organization;*child;self report;actimetry;arousal;population;maximum likelihood method;generalized anxiety disorder;model;patient worry;alertness;latent period;insomnia;diagnosis;juvenile;female;spectroscopy;night;electroencephalogram;nonoxinol 9;Only Child;Child;Anxiety Disorders;Anxiety;Sleep,,,,Sleep misperception and its clinical correlates in children with anxiety disorders,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Neill, WellSleep, University of Otago, Wellington, New Zealand","Introduction: Clinical phenotypic modelling (by A N. Vgontzasa et al, 2013) indicate there are important prognostic differences between insomnia with objectively short sleep duration which is the most severe and subjective insomnia with normal sleep duration who experience cognitive-emotional and cortical arousal and sleep state misperception (SSM) but have a much better prognosis. SSM appears to be quite common primary insomnia (PI). The aim of the study was to use home technologies to look for evidence of SSM, objectively short and long sleep phenotypes in a group of primary insomniacs and whether objective short sleepers had any identifying clinical characteristics. Method(s): Sleep was measured in 17 insomniacs (5 men, 12 women) by sleep diary, actigraphy and two home polysomnograms over 4 weeks. Subjective Total Sleep Time (TST) was determined by documenting sleep onset latency (SOL), wake after sleep onset (WASO) and final wake-up. Subjects were divided into short (TST < 6.5 hours/night) and normal length sleepers then compared using non-parametric analyses. Polysomnography was scored by using AASM guidelines. Result(s): 5 (29%) were objectively short sleepers (mean TST = 363 minutes), 12(71%) were normal sleepers (mean TST = 456 minutes). Significant sleep misperception occurred in approximately half of the subjects and correlated with TST, those having longer sleep times, were more likely to underestimate TST; r2 = 0.29. Objectively normal length insomniacs on average misperceived 48.9 mins of sleep representing 6.7% of TST whereas short sleepers did not (p = 0.29). Both short and normal length sleepers overestimated SOL. There were no significant differences in Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), impairment score and ESS between short and normal length sleepers. Conclusion(s): Sleep state misperception is common in PI, particularly in those with objectively normal length sleep where it is greater than normal healthy sleepers. Clinical tools including self-estimate of TST, ISI, impairment score and ESS did not predict objective short sleep phenotype. Home sleep EEG or actigraphy is superior to subjective estimates in determining short vs. long sleep duration insomnia phenotype.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,"*sleep;*primary insomnia;*phenotype;sleep time;insomnia;human;actimetry;technology;prognosis;model;polysomnography;latent period;female;male;Insomnia Severity Index;arousal;electroencephalogram;Sleep Disorders;Phenotype;Sleep Disorders, Intrinsic;Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders",,,,Objective measurements are needed to determine sleep state misperception and short sleep phenotype in primary insomnia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We conducted retrospective chart reviews on individuals who self-identified as having epilepsy in a questionnaire database of patients who underwent polysomnography (PSG) in a sleep laboratory at a quaternary medical center. We confirmed 64 patients with epilepsy in the database. For total sleep time (TST) and sleep latency (SL), we calculated the difference between that reported by the patient on questionnaire and that measured by PSG. The median TST underestimation was 45 minutes (-180 to 60, P < 0.05) and the median SL overestimation was 20 minutes (-10 to 170, P < 0.05). This pattern of misperception is similar to that reported in patients with insomnia. There was no statistically significant difference based on categorical epilepsy refractoriness, cognitive impairment, or psychiatric comorbidity.

This study investigated factors affecting subjective perception of sleep in the morning in patients with insomnia. Material(s) and Method(s): In this retrospective cross-sectional study, we evaluated 400 adults who had nocturnal polysomnography (nPSG) in the center for sleep and chronobiology of Seoul National University Hospital. Participants completed self-report questionnaire including Beck depression inventory (BDI), Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI), and Epworth sleepiness scale before nPSG. In the morning after the nPSG, participants evaluated their sleep with following self-report items: subjective sleep latency, subjective total sleep time, subjective number of awakening, and level of refreshed in the morning (4 point Likert scale). Patients with insomnia - with insomnia symptoms (> 3months), PSQI score > 5, Apnea hypopnea index < 15, and periodic limb movement index < 5 - were collected and analyzed. Finally, a total of 109 patients with insomnia (female n = 37, 33.9%; age 43.39 +/- 15.32 years; body mass index 24.83 +/- 3.29) were included for the analysis. Pearson and Spearman correlation analysis were used to determine the factors affecting subjective self-report of the previous sleep in the morning. (Significance level p < 0.05). Result(s): After adjusting for age, sex and BDI score, subjective sleep latency on the self-report in the morning was positively correlated with sleep latency on nPSG (r = 0.338, p < 0.001). Subjective total sleep time was positively correlated with total sleep time on nPSG (r = 0.365, p < 0.001). Subjective total sleep time was negatively correlated with PSQI score (r = -0.320, p = 0.001). The association between subjective total sleep time and PSQI score was consistent after adjusting for total sleep time or wake after sleep onset on nPSG. Level of refreshed in the morning from sleep was associated with BDI (r = - 0.342, p < 0.001) and PSQI scores (r = - 0.224, p = 0.019), but not with any objective sleep parameters on nPSG. Conclusion(s): Our results demonstrated that subjectively perceived sleep latency and sleep time in the morning was associated with objectively measured sleep latency and sleep time, respectively. Short perceived sleep time in the morning is also related with poor sleep quality on PSQI. Refreshed feeling after the sleep is not associated with objective sleep measures but with subjectively measured depressed mood symptoms and sleep quality. Patients with insomnia feel less refreshed after the sleep as they are more depressed and report poorer sleep quality.

First, this experiment aimed at investigating how well the subjective complaints of par ticipants were related to objective measures of sleep quality. Second, we hypothesized that participants with a more intense physical activity would increase their sleep pressure, and therefore suffer less from the possible circadian disruption due to the constant daylight conditions. Method(s): 8 subjects were investigated in the first expedition. Actigraphy data were collected for 48 hrs every ten days. Sleep efficiency (sleep time/lying down time) as well as sleep fractionation were computed, and related to active energy expenditure. 15 subjects participated during the second campaign. Data were collected every 2 weeks for each subject. These included 48 hrs actigraphy, a sleep diary, one night polysomnography, morning and evening Profile of Mood States and Karolinska Sleepiness Scale and morning Psychomotor Vigilance Test. Morning and evening saliva samples were taken to determine melatonin levels. Circa- dian rhythms were determined with 2hrs-spaced cortisol sampling. Result(s): First year data showed poor sleep efficiency and high sleep fractionation, in concordance with participants' subjective evaluations. Furthermore, there was a strong correlation between sleep efficiency and active energy expenditure (Pearson's r = 0,63; p = 0,015), as well as a strong relationship between active energy expenditure and sleep fractionation. Second year data collection is still ongoing until February 2009. Conclusion(s): Results from the first campaign confirmed both our hypotheses, namely the lower sleep quality (lower efficiency and higher fractionation) during the expedition and the relationship between sleep quality and active energy expenditure. Data from the second campaign will confirm whether a decreased melatonin secretion is a causal mechanism of the impaired sleep quality, and how strong is the impact upon mood and performance.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,*sleep;*summer;*health care organization;*travel;*Antarctica;*sleep waking cycle;*circadian rhythm;*physical activity;fractionation;energy expenditure;actimetry;alertness;saliva;rhythm;night;sampling;information processing;hypothesis;secretion;mood;sunlight;polysomnography;Profile of Mood States;somnolence;melatonin;hydrocortisone;Circadian Rhythm;Wakefulness;Motor Activity,,,,"Circadian rhythms, physical activity and their influence on sleep-wake regulation during an antarctic summer expedition",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Method(s): A total of 348 clinical records of young patients (aged 0-61 months) evaluated by Pediatric Sleep Medicine with a presenting complaint necessitating a formal overnight PSG from January 1, 2001 to December 31, 2020 were reviewed. Subjective caregiver reports of sleep concerns were coded and cross-matched to clinician interpretation of findings from the PSG. Statistical analysis was performed using a McNemar Test to evaluate accordance between caregiver concerns and PSG results. Result(s): Caregiver-reported difficulties of sleep characteristics including problematic sleep onset, ""doesn't sleep,"" and frequent nighttime awakenings had very poor agreement with PSG findings (McNemar p < 0.0001; Kappa = 0.16[0.084,0.24]). Similarly, caregiver report of restless sleep and parasomnias compared with PSG data had very poor agreement (McNemar p < 0.0001; Kappa = 0.08[-0.0006,0.17], and McNemar p < 0.0001; Kappa = 0.17[0.025,0.32], respectively). Caregiver report of patient snoring had poor agreement with PSG data (McNemar p = 0.73; Kappa = 0.23[0.13,0.33]). Conclusion(s): Previous literature on early childhood sleep difficulties has relied primarily on subjective caregiver report of sleep concerns. These studies have been used to explore subsequent development of mental illness comorbidities. Data from our study suggest that caregiver report of sleep concerns are significantly different from objective findings obtained through formal PSG, leading our team to question the clinical validity of caregiver-based reports of sleep difficulties in young children. Additional research is needed to assist clinicians in eliciting accurate and objective sleep concerns in pediatric patients.

Studies found increased physiological activation in this condition. This study aimed to investigate sleep characteristics and nocturnal cardiovascular parameters among healthy subjects not complaining of sleep disorders, with either low or high accuracy in their sleep duration perception. Method(s): We studied 21 healthy subjects (14 women; mean age = 45.0+/-8.9 years). Heart rate (HR) and non invasive beat-to-beat blood pressure (BP) were continuously recorded during one night of polysomnography. Subjects were free of any medical, psychiatric or sleep disorders and weren't on any medication. Subjects were divided in 2 groups: (1) high accuracy group: difference between objective (polysomnographic) and subjective sleep duration <30 minutes, mean difference = -8.6+/-18.2, n=9; (2) low accuracy group: underestimation greater than 30 minutes, mean difference = 73.6+/-34.0, n=12. Betweengroup differences were assessed with t-tests. Result(s): The 2 groups were similar in age, body mass index and objective sleep measures, i.e. sleep latency, sleep efficiency, total sleep time, number of awakenings and micro-arousals index. Mean HR during the night was also similar. However, the low accuracy group had higher mean nocturnal systolic BP (111.7+/-11.5 versus 100.3+/-11.9 mmHg, p=0.04) and diastolic BP (62.6+/-8.6 versus 55.4+/-4.7 mmHg, p=0.04) compared to the high accuracy group. Conclusion(s): This study shows that healthy subjects underestimating their sleep duration have higher nocturnal BP. These results support studies reporting increased physiological activation in inaccurate sleep perception and emphasize the link between paradoxical insomnia and hyperarousal.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,*sleep;*consultation;*normal human;*psychosomatics;*blood pressure;*liaison psychiatry;insomnia;sleep disorder;night;arousal;heart rate;polysomnography;drug therapy;Student t test;body mass;sleep time;patient;cardiovascular parameters;female,,,,Increased nocturnal blood pressure in relation to inaccurate sleep perception in healthy subjects,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, morning memory performance for word stimuli presented during sleep was assessed for its association with Sleep State Misperception. Method(s): Nine subjects participated in this pilot study (4 w/ insomnia [mean age 43.5 +/- 10.8 and 50% female] and 5 good sleepers [mean age 37.0 +/- 12.7 and 60% female]. During the experimental night, subjects were played single-word stimuli across multiple time periods including: sleep onset (Trial 1) and at the sleep onset transitions following up to three natural awakenings. Subjects were tested for free recall, recognition memory, and for implicit memory for the word stimuli following ~6hrs time in bed. AM Diaries were acquired from each subject and Subjective-Objective (Sub-Ob) discrepancy scores were calculated for Sleep Latency (SL), Wake After Sleep Onset (WASO) and for Total Sleep Time (TST), e.g., Sub-Ob Score = sSL-oSL. Data analysis was accomplished by correlating Sub-Ob scores with memory performance values. Result(s): The groups did not differ with respect to PSG measures, diary assessed sleep continuity, Sub-Ob discrepancy scores, or memory performance. Correlational analyses for the 3 Sub-Ob values and the 3 memory assessments revealed that the Sub-Ob values for WASO were signiicantly correlated with recognition (r =0.82, p=.006) and the Sub- Ob values for TST tended to be associated with implicit memory performance (r =-0.61, p=.082). Conclusion(s): The lack of group indings may be attributable to a variety of factors including level of homeostatic pressure for sleep and current stress level. This said, the correlational indings are consistent with prior work suggesting that Sleep State Misperception is associated with an alteration of the normal mesograde amnesia of sleep.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,"*sleep;*implicit memory;*organization;memory;stimulus;amnesia;female;night;implantable cardioverter defibrillator;arousal;insomnia;data analysis;sleep time;recall;pilot study;modulation;Sleep Disorders, Intrinsic;Memory",,,,Explicit and implicit memory correlates of sleep state misperception,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pietkiewicz, Woolcock Institute of Medical Research, University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia","Sleep misperception, where subjective estimations of sleep are underestimated compared to objective total sleep time (TST) is common in insomnia and has been found to reduce during sleep restriction therapy (SRT). Changes from baseline remain to be profiled. This study investigates sleep misperception prior to and during SRT for Psychophysiological Insomnia (PI). Eight participants with PI (mean age = 46; 6 female) underwent two weeks of baseline study and 5 weeks of SRT. Daily discrepancies between subjectively-defined TST (sleep diaries) and objectively-defined TST (actigraphy) were analysed through a misperception index (MI) [(objective TST - subjective TST)/objective TST]. Results ranged from -1 to +1, positive values signify underestimation of sleep. It was hypothesised that sleep misperception would improve with increases in subjective TST. Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) subjectively quantified treatment response and improved with the intervention (mean (SD) = 18.2 (2.8), 8.4 = (4.8) p < .01). Actigraphic and sleep diary data was collected in 5 participants. Mixed effects models found MI scores decreased significantly between baseline and week 5 (mean (95% CI): 0.21 (0.14, 0.28) vs -0.01 (-0.76, 0.56), p < .01). Improvements were found for subjective TST ((min): 338.4 (281.4, 395.4) vs. 373.2 (316.3, 430.2), p < .05). SRT reduced objective TST in the first week compared to baseline (421.8 (373.0, 470.5) vs. 335.91 (287.1, 384.8), p < .01). TST then increased between weeks 1-5 (335.91 (287.1, 384.8) vs. 369.4 (320.5, 418.3), p < .01) but did not recover to the number of minutes at baseline. Although subjective underestimation of sleep was reduced, objective sleep did not fully recover within the 5 week time period. However, the MI change is a valuable clinical outcome as it enables individuals to estimate their sleep more accurately.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,*sleep;*actimetry;*therapy;*insomnia;human;model;treatment response;Insomnia Severity Index;female;sleep time;Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders;Sleep,,,,Sleep misperception in insomnia: An exploratory assessment of changes in the subjective estimation of sleep compared to actigraphy through 5-weeks of sleep restriction therapy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover there is a lack of procedures for the evaluation of both variables, because self-reported sleep may not reflect objective sleep patterns, being this a matter of discussion. The comparison among the feeling of a good sleep and several objective variables from the sleep measured by one night full polysomnography (PSG) in Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) patients during the determination of the continuous positive air pressure (CPAP) in the sleep lab. Material(s) and Method(s): The self-reported feeling of a good sleep was characterized by the answer to the question ""Have you slept well?; (yes or not)""? Provided by the patients in the morning after the PSG, and was compared with the values obtained for several variables measured from the PSG in 107 patients to titrate CPAP pressure from a single night in the sleep laboratory. Result(s): A group of 107 patients was studied. From them, 68 cases (45 males and 23 females) considered that the sleep was ""good"", whereas the remaining 39 cases (27 males and 12 females) answered that the sleep was ""bad"". The following variables were compared between both groups: The body mass index (BMI), proportion of different sleep stages, latency of sleep onset, number of awaking from sleep, CPAP pressure and sleep efficiency (SE). The results obtained revealed that only SE (p = 0.003), total sleep time (TST), (p = 0.011) and CPAP pressure (p = 0.035) showed significant differences between groups. The value of SE was high within the group feeling a good sleep, which also showed higher valued of CPAP. Nevertheless, according with the majority of the bibliography, this last behavior would be associated with a worse sleep thus, the results obtained in this work may be indicate better CPAP adjustment in this group. As was expected, the TST also showed significant differences between groups, being higher in the group that felt a better sleep. The complete interpretation of these results will be difficult because the feeling of the ""good"" or ""bad""sleep may be influenced by several no controlled factors. Conclusion(s): The sleep efficiency and the Total sleep time could be an objective marker of a subjective feeling of a good sleep in a subset of patients.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,*sleep;*sleep medicine;*human;*society;*patient;night;positive end expiratory pressure;sleep time;female;male;polysomnography;sleep pattern;latent period;sleep stage;body mass;laboratory;atmospheric pressure;procedures;sleep disordered breathing;publication;population;marker,,,,Comparison between the objectively measured and the subjective sleep in a group of patients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Presti, US Army Medical Research Directorate-West, Mc Chord, WA, United States","Introduction: Research has demonstrated that military personnel sleep less and experience poorer quality sleep than the general civilian population and that sleep problems are related to degraded performance. However, differences in methodology for measuring sleep quantity and quality, as well as a lack of operationally-relevant performance metrics have led to challenges in demonstrating the importance of sleep in military populations. The goal of this analysis was to examine novel approaches of deriving sleep quality and quantity statistics and their relationships to health and performance outcomes in military settings. Method(s): Two studies of US Army Soldiers operating in Europe were used in the analysis, one during a training exercise and the other following a combat deployment to Afghanistan. In both studies, Soldiers completed health surveys at multiple time points and wore actigraphs. These data sources were used to examine discrepancies between self-report and objective sleep duration and to examine sleep patterns, including the shifting of sleep onset and offset times. These data, in addition to traditional sleep metrics, were then linked to health and performance outcomes. Result(s): 167 (Study 1) and 87 (Study 2) Soldiers completed the studies. Initial analysis suggests that novel sleep statistics, such as discrepancies between subjectively and objectively-measured sleep and tendencies towards shifting of normal sleep patterns have a greater impact on the health of Soldiers and performance of military tasks than traditional measures of sleep quantity and quality. Conclusion(s): Perceptions of sleep and sleep routines are particularly important factors for maintaining health and optimal performance in Soldiers. A better understanding is needed of the specific aspects and timing of sleep that are most relevant to the unique day-to-day functioning of military personnel in various real-world environments. Training on the impact of insufficient sleep and disruptions to normal sleep routines should be incorporated into the military culture.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,actigraph;Afghanistan;Europe;exercise;health survey;human;perception;self report;sleep disorder;*sleep pattern;sleep quality;sleep time;*soldier;stage 1 sleep;statistics;conference abstract;Military Personnel;Sleep,,,,Characterizing the impact of sleep on health and performance in military operational units,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We sought to determine if detection of movement at the upper or lower extremity is representative of the actual patient activity and which of the two locations has a higher correlation with a nursing reported sleep diary. METHOD(S): We conducted a prospective observational study, enrolling patients receiving mechanical ventilation and admitted to the cardiovascular ICU after elective surgery. Upon admission to the ICU, wrist and ankle actigraphy recordings were initiated for 24 hours. Concurrently, nurses recorded hourly observations of sleep. Wrist and ankle actigraphy were used to determine the proportion of total sleep time (TST) in 24 hours during nighttime (defined as 22:00 to 05:59), TST in 24 hours, and arousal index (number of arousals/hour) during nighttime. RESULT(S): 10 patients were enrolled (2 female, 8 male, average age 64.4, SD: 11.4). From the actigraphy data, TST at night was 354 minutes (SD: 354) at the wrist and 402 minutes (SD: 86) at the ankle. TST in 24 hours was 672 minutes (SD: 271) at the wrist and 883 minutes (SD: 278) at the ankle. The mean arousal index was 5.8 (SD: 3.5) at the wrist and 2.7 (SD: 1.7) at the ankle. Of patients with complete nursing logs (n=6), TST at night was 288 minutes (SD: 248) and TST in 24 hours was 480 minutes (SD: 197). The proportion of TST in 24 hours at night was 53% from wrist recordings, 58% from ankle recordings, and 75% from nurse observation. There was no correlation between wrist actigraphy and nurse observation (correlation coefficient 0.56), while there was a higher correlation between ankle actigraphy and nurse observation (correlation coefficient 0.80). CONCLUSION(S): There were substantial discrepancies between wrist and ankle actigraphy data, compared with nurse observation. While sleep measured at the ankle seemed to overestimate nursereported sleep, there was a stronger correlation between nurse observation and ankle activity. These preliminary data suggest that when comparing actigraphy to the nursing sleep diaries, although ankle actigraphy overestimates sleep at night, ankle recordings might be more representative of nursing observation than wrist activity data. These data also confirm previous findings that ICU patients' sleep patterns can be disrupted at night and that a substantial amount of sleep occurs during the daytime.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,accelerometer;*actimetry;adult;*ankle;arousal;artificial ventilation;circadian rhythm;clinical article;coronary care unit;correlation coefficient;*critically ill patient;delirium;elective surgery;female;human;male;middle aged;nurse;observational study;range of motion;sleep time;*sleep waking cycle;*wrist;Critical Illness;Wakefulness;Ankle,,,,Difference between wrist and ankle actigraphy to estimate sleep-wake cycle in critically-ill patients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Provencher, School of Psychology, Laval University, Quebec, QC, Canada","Objectives/Introduction: Individuals with insomnia (INS) have been shown to present instabilities in REM sleep, known to possibly interfere with basic processes such as emotional regulation, sleep perception or memory. Because these processes are underpinned by cortical networks, REM sleep disruption can be accompanied by perceptible changes in electroencephalographic (EEG) brain activity. Such alterations, usually absent in good sleepers (GS), may be measured as variations in brain connectivity, including changes in EEG asymmetry. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate and quantify patterns of asymmetry between frontal, central, parietal and occipital derivations in GS and INS. We aimed to assess the association between these asymmetry patterns and sleep misperception, as well as the severity of insomnia and daytime anxious and depressive symptoms. Method(s): To assess patterns of asymmetry, standard EEG was recorded in 62 right-handed individuals (43 INS; 19 GS) for three nights in a sleep laboratory. Intrahemispheric asymmetry measures were based on EEG power spectral analysis (0-60 Hz) computed between pairs of regions at fronto-central, fronto-parietal, fronto-occipital, centro-parietal, centro-occipital and parieto-occipital derivations. Differences between groups were assessed with repeated-measures ANOVAs. Correlations were then performed on asymmetry and sleep misperception, as well as self-reported daytime anxiety and depressive symptoms, and insomnia severity. Significance levels were set at p < 0.05. Result(s): Compared to GS, INS presented increased theta (4-8 Hz) asymmetry in the left hemisphere between frontal (F3) and parietal (P3) derivations, but only during REM sleep, F(1, 62) = 7.95, p = 0.006. Activity was 42% higher at F3 in INS, but only 6% in GS. This pattern of asymmetry was negatively associated with total sleep time misperception in GS, r = -0.324, p < 0.05. Associations were found with depressive and insomnia complaints, positive in INS (r= {0.182, 0.205}), and negative in GS (r= {-0.559, -0.406}). Conclusion(s): Because an association with insomnia symptoms lies within this fronto-parietal pattern of asymmetry, these findings suggest it may serve as a distinctive cortical biomarker of insomnia.

Assessment in clinical settings does not typically include the use of objective sleep measures however and the extent to which subjective reports correspond with actual sleep parameters is unknown. The current study therefore examined correspondence between parent reported and actigraphy-assessed sleep among children with GAD in comparison to a nonclinical sample of youth. Method(s): The sample (N=43) included 24 children with primary GAD and 19 healthy control children, 6 to 11 years. All children underwent structured diagnostic interviews. Sleep was assessed based on parent report and actigraphy on 5 weekdays. Speciic bedtimes, wake-up times, and total sleep duration were compared. Result(s): Partial correlation coeficients revealed signiicant moderate associations for bedtime (r = .48, p < .05) and total sleep time (r = .57, p < .05) and a strong correlation for wake-up time (r = .73, p < .01) among controls. In the GAD group, a signiicant association was found for wake-up time only (r = .64, p < .01). Correspondence between parent reported and actigraphy-based total sleep was particularly low in the GAD group (r = .13). To better understand this inding, a paired sample t-test was conducted comparing measurement of total sleep in the GAD group. The result indicated that parents of children with GAD overestimated total sleep time as compared to actigraphy (t (1,23) = 5.25, p < .001). Conclusion(s): Findings suggest that parents of anxious children may be less accurate reporters of their children's sleep as compared to parents of non-anxious children. The clinical implications of these indings are discussed.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,*sleep;*human;*child;*organization;*parent;actimetry;sleep time;implantable cardioverter defibrillator;Student t test;structured interview;juvenile;sleep parameters;generalized anxiety disorder,,,,Discrepancies between parent reported and objectively-assessed sleep in anxious and healthy children,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The underlying mechanisms for the mortality risk increase in long sleepers are unknown. Objective(s): To test, whether long self-reported sleep duration is paralleled by impaired objectively measured sleep efficiency and to assess whether impaired sleep efficiency is an independent risk factor for death in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF). Hypotheses were formulated after data collection. Design, Setting, Patients: Observational study of 211 consecutive CHF patients (age 63+/-10 years, 89% men, left ventricular ejection fraction 34+/-10%), who underwent polysomnography and completed standardized questionnaires between 1/2002 and 12/2009 at the University Hospital Regensburg. Main Outcome: All cause mortality ascertained by medical documents. Follow-up was performed between 12/2009 and 01/2010 (mean follow-up time: 44+/-26 months). Methods and Results: Comparison of objective sleep efficiency in CHF patients showed an inverse U-shaped relationship according to quintiles of self-reported sleep duration: Sleep efficiency in CHF patients from the highest quintile (>=9h of self-reported sleep duration) was significantly lower as compared to the middle quintile with 7.25-8h of self-reported sleep duration (71+/-15% versus 77+/-11%, p=0.032) and identical to the lowest quintile (<=5.75h of self-reported sleep duration; 71+/-15% versus 71+/-16%, p=0.950). Fifty-seven patients died during follow-up. Objective sleep efficiency, age, left ventricular ejection fraction and cause of CHF were identified as independent risk factors for all-cause mortality in a multivariate adjusted survival analysis (p<0.001, p=0.022, p=0.005 and p=0.002, respectively), while self-reported sleep duration did not influence mortality. Conclusion(s): Objective sleep efficiency is significantly impaired in CHF patients with prolonged self-reported sleep duration compared to those with medium self-reported sleep duration, suggesting a misperception of sleep in these patients. In contrast to self-reported sleep duration, objective sleep efficiency predicts mortality in CHF patients independently from age, cardiac function and cause of CHF.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,*sleep;*human;*patient;*mortality;*medical society;*prognosis;*heart failure;*sleep apnea syndrome;follow up;heart left ventricle ejection fraction;risk factor;university hospital;survival;heart function;death;hypothesis;information processing;observational study;male;polysomnography;questionnaire;Heart Failure,,,,Prognostic impact of sleep duration and sleep efficiency on mortality in patients with chronic heart failure,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Users of such devices are turning to clinicians and fitness professionals for guidance on how to best utilize these devices for sleep, but little evidence exists to guide these discussions. This study compares three commercially-available sleep tracking devices, the Fitbit Charge HR (Fitbit), Beddit 2 (Beddit), and ResMed S+ (ResMed), for accuracy at estimating total sleep time (TST) over seven consecutive nights against the clinically-validated Philips Actiwatch 64 (Actiwatch). Method(s): Forty-eight participants, aged 19-64 years (mean=35.1, SD=10.2, 72.9% female) used three tracking devices over the seven day trial. Each device has different placement requirements - the wrist (Fitbit), under the bedsheet (Beddit), and on the nightstand (ResMed). All participants were determined to be good sleepers, as defined by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Participants with a Global PSQI score greater than four were excluded. Throughout the study, participants completed the American Academy of Sleep Medicine sleep diary. Each device's estimated TST was compared with that from the participant's recall sleep diary and the Actiwatch. Result(s): There were significant differences between the three devices and the sleep diary, with the devices underreporting sleep by 25 to 49 minutes on average (p<=0.05). The Fitbit and the Beddit estimated mean TST did not differ significantly from the Actiwatch (p=0.12 and 0.59 respectively). The ResMed estimated mean TST was slightly lower than the Actiwatch (by 12.8 minutes, p=0.045). Users rated the disruptiveness of the devices at an average of 1.2 on a scale of 0 to 10 with a score of ""0"" being indicative of not being disruptive, while ""10"" was extremely disruptive. Conclusion(s): Commercially-available sleep tracking devices can reasonably estimate TST in adults with ""good"" sleep, although they tend to slightly underestimate TST compared to self-report. The devices tested do not seem to disrupt sleep. Clinicians and fitness professionals could review data from these devices, in conjunction with clinical data, to help ascertain whether healthy subjects are obtaining sufficient sleep.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,*actimetry;adult;clinical article;clinician;controlled study;female;human;human experiment;male;night;Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index;recall;self report;*sleep time;wrist;young adult;conference abstract,,,,Comparison of commercially-available sleep tracking devices with sleep diary and actigraphy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Polysomnography (PSG) reveals only slightly altered ""objective"" sleep patterns in patients with primary insomnia (PI) compared to subjective complaints. Recent studies point out that alterations of sleep microstructure might explain this discrepancy and that REM sleep as the most aroused brain state during sleep is especially vulnerable to this type of disturbance. To test this assumption, an awakening study from NonREM and REM sleep was performed. Methods and findings: We studied 27 GSC and 27 patients with PI (age- and gender-matched) for four consecutive night in the sleep laboratory. In nights 3 and 4 all subjects were awakened three times each out of REM sleep or stable stage 2 sleep according to a balanced design. Upon awakening, subjects were questioned about their state of consciousness prior to awakening (asleep vs awake) - interestingly, patients with PI only after REM sleep awakenings more significantly indicated having been awake in contrast to GSC, but not when awoken out of stage 2 sleep. PI subjects rated their ""sleep mentation"" as more emotionally negative compared to GSC. Conclusion(s): This study for the first time shows that the subjective experience of insomnia might be especially coupled to the REM sleep state. Assuming chronic hyperarousal as a central pathway for insomnia, this might become especially evident during REM sleep, thus reflecting a ""hybrid"" state in insomnia being coupled with an altered perception of being awake vs. asleep.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,*arousal;clinical article;consciousness;controlled study;female;gender;human;human versus animal comparison;male;*night sleep;nonhuman;*nonREM sleep;*perception;*primary insomnia;wakefulness;Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders,,,,Perception of sleep in insomnia disorder: A NonREM/REM sleep awakening study,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients with mood disorders such as depression exhibit emotion dysregulation and poor sleep quality, including insomnia which do not relate to subjective ratings of sleep. However, less is known about sleep and its effects on emotion regulation in anxiety disorders. This study evaluated the relationship between sleep and emotion regulation in anxious patients, via Reappraisal and Suppression, the former considered to be an adaptive, optimal regulation strategy. Method(s): As part of a larger study, objective and subjective sleep measures were collected from 17 patients with social phobia, generalized anxiety disorder, or panic disorder using actigraph and sleep logs to record sleep-wake patterns and sleep disturbances for 7 nights/8 days. Sleep indexes included total sleep time, sleep eficiency, and overall sleep quality ratings. Reappraisal and Suppression strategies were examined with the Emotional Regulation Questionnaire. Result(s): On average, patients slept 6.34 +/- 0.89 hours per night indicative of shorter sleep duration than typically shown in healthy individuals. Consistent with previous studies, there was no relationship between objective and subjective sleep measures. Here, patients tended to overestimate sleep duration. Among sleep measures, a positive correlation between objective total sleep length and Reappraisal emerged, (p < 0.05). No correlations were observed for Suppression. Conclusion(s): Anxiety patients' ratings of sleep quality were unrelated to actual sleep length or eficiency. Findings highlight the importance of using objective sleep measures when studying sleep quality in anxiety disorders, which may be of therapeutic value. Reappraisal, an adaptive emotional regulation strategy, was shown to positively correlate with objective sleep length. Suggesting that patients who sleep more hours per night are better able to employ a regulation strategy that is associated with healthy functioning or the ability to utilize Reappraisal may contribute to optimal sleep duration.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,*sleep;*human;*organization;*anxiety disorder;*patient;*emotionality;sleep quality;sleep time;night;emotion;anxiety;questionnaire;mood disorder;mood;sleep disorder;panic;generalized anxiety disorder;social phobia;insomnia;Anxiety Disorders,,,,Relationships between objective and subjective sleep measures and emotion regulation in patients with anxiety disorders,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rosales-Rodriguez, Medical University of Vienna, Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Vienna, Austria","Introduction: Although sleep research has been interested in the relationship between objective and subjective sleep and awakening parameters for decades, findings are still equivocal. This may be due to the lack of large data bases on gender differences and age-related changes, but also to the obvious differences between different sleep disorders. Another problem in the statistical evaluation of this relationship are inter-individual differences in sleep perception. Aim(s): This study aimed (1) to investigate the relation between subjective and objective sleep based on sleep efficiency (SE) under consideration of gender- and age-related differences in a large group of normals and (2) to determine the correlation between subjectively and polysomnographically measured SE in patients suffering from apnea and insomnia due to generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) as compared with normals. Method(s): In 177 normals (50.9+/-19.6a), 61 GAD (37.9+/-10.6a) and 51 apnea patients (51.3+/-9.7a), subjective sleep efficiency was determined by means of the self-rating scale for sleep and awakening quality (SSA) [1] in two consecutive nights - one adaptation (A) and one baseline (B) night. Objective parameters were classified by the Somnolyzer [2]. The correlation between subjective and objective SE was analyzed separately for each night as well as for change values between the two nights (A-B) in order to diminish inter-individual variances of sleep perception. Result(s): In normals subjective SE was better than objective SE, only in the adaptation night (p<0.01). With regard to gender differences, male subjects significantly overestimated their subjective SE as compared to objective SE in the adaptation night (p<0.01), while in females there was no difference between subjectively rated and polysomnographically measured SE. Older subjects (60-95a) significantly overestimated their subjective SE (p<0.01), while younger ones showed no differences between subjective and objective SE. In the insomnia group, subjective SE was significantly lower than objective SE in both nights (p<0.01). Apnea patients showed no differences between subjectively reported and polysomnographically measured SE. Regarding correlation analyses between subjective and objective SE, significant correlations were found for both nights in normals (A: r = 0.45; B: r = 0.19), apnea (A: r = .61; B: r = 0.40) and GAD patients (A: r = 0.61; B: r = 0.58). However, correlations based on change values between the adaptation and baseline night (A-B) were stronger than those determined in one night only and reached significant values in all three groups: normals r = 0.51 (p<0.01), apnea r = 0.57 (p<0.01) and GAD patients r = 0.77 (p<0.01). The misperception of subjective as compared with objective SE was calculated in all groups and varied from 31% in normals, over 34% in apnea to 23% in insomnia/GAD patients. Conclusion(s): This study shows a positive correlation between subjective and objective SE in normals, apnea and GAD patients, however the correlation between subjective and objective sleep based on the change-values (A-B) is stronger than analyses based on one night only, because this method diminishes the interindividual variance of sleep perception. In addition we analysed for the first time, to our knowledge, the gender- and age-dependent relations between subjective and objective SE in normals.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,"*sleep;*apnea;*insomnia;*patient;*human;*generalized anxiety disorder;*college;*psychopharmacology;night;adaptation;parameters;arousal;gender;sex difference;data base;correlation analysis;male;rating scale;self concept;sleep disorder;female;Anxiety Disorders;Sleep Apnea, Obstructive;Apnea;Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders",,,,Objective versus subjective sleep efficiency in apnea and insomnia patients due to generalised anxiety disorder as compared with normals,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined the effect of zolpidem on time perception during sleep and correlated sleep features (wake after sleep onset (WASO), sleep latency and total sleep time (TST)) with subjective sleep time (SST) estimations. We asked: 1) What is the effect of zolpidem on SST? and 2) Which features of sleep are associated with SST? Methods: In a within-subjects design, 19 (11F) healthy, young adults, received zolpidem (5mg or 10mg) or placebo, followed by a 90-minute, polysomnographically recorded nap and SST was reported on a post-nap questionnaire. We evaluated SST estimations in minutes (Ts) and the difference between SST and TST (Td), where a positive score indicated an overestimation of sleep time. We analyzed drug effects using a repeated- measures ANOVA on the following variables: Ts, Td, WASO, sleep latency, and TST. Correlations between SST, and the aforementioned sleep features were evaluated. Result(s): Both zolpidem groups showed longer Ts compared to placebo (5mg: p=.03; 10m: p=.005). Td indicated TST was underestimated more in the placebo condition compared with zolpidem (5mg p=.100 and 10m p=.003). WASO was negatively correlated with Ts in all three drug conditions (placebo (r=-.729, p=.001), zolpidem 5mg (r=-.826, p=.000) and zolpidem 10mg (r=-.635, p=.005)). Zolpidem (10 mg) also showed signiicantly higher WASO (p<.006) compared to placebo. No signiicant differences in TST or sleep latency were observed. Conclusion(s): A pharmacological intervention produced longer sleep time estimations in zolpidem compared to placebo. Sleep time biases were negatively correlated with WASO within each condition, suggesting that zolpidem may increase subjective sleep time by decreasing minutes of WASO.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,*sleep;*sleep time;*time perception;*organization;questionnaire;young adult;environment;drug effect;physiology;analysis of variance;*zolpidem;placebo,,,,Zolpidem increases subjective sleep time estimations in daytime naps,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So far, there are only a few experimental data about sleep quality under chronic stress. Method(s): This experiment is a part of the project 'Mars-105'. Six healthy males were isolated in the model of spaceship for 105 days. Their sleep was studied by questionnaires (sleep dairy every 6 days) and standard polysomnography. Two consecutive nights sleep recordings were performed before, 2 weeks and 3 months after onset of the experiment. Then they were scored according to standard criteria of the American Association of Sleep Medicine. Fisher's combined probability test was used to analyze time evolution of sleep changes. Result(s): Sleep diary shows that the 'astronauts' went to bed late (in average 1:15 a.m.), had prolonged subjective sleep latency (>=20 min) and long night awakenings (>=30 min). They had daytime sleepiness (more than a half of cases) and naps 2-3 times a week. Polysomnographic recordings confirm problems to fall asleep (sleep latency >=20 min in 20% of all recordings) and long night awakenings (>=30 min in 24%). Analysis of time progress of these insomnia-like changes by subjective and objective data was performed. Amount of the 'pathologic' recordings was statistically significant increased at the end of third month of isolation in comparison with background data (P < 0.05) and polysomnographies during second week of isolation (P < 0.05). In opposite, subjective quality of sleep elevated from onset to end of the experiment. Conclusion(s): Longterm isolation led to insomnia-like changes in healthy men. This confirms that chronic stress may be a cause of sleep disorders. In contrary to insomniac patients, who usually overestimate their sleep problems, our 'astronauts' showed less progress of subjective complains compare with polysomnographic data. This may be possible mechanism prevented development of insomnia in healthy persons.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,*sleep;*society;*chronic stress;human;recording;insomnia;night;sleep disorder;arousal;cosmonaut;male;polysomnography;patient;questionnaire;sleep quality;daytime somnolence;model;sleep medicine;astronomy;normal human;Sleep,,,,Sleep changes under condition of chronic stress,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sagrada, University Hospital San Raffaele, Milan, Italy","Objectives: The error in sleep estimation (ESE) is common in healthy, but overall in insomniac subjects. There is the idea that sleep misperception (SM) in paradoxical insomnia (PI) is simply an exaggeration of the normal phenomenon. There is no unanimous index to quantify SM and to decide a possible threshold value to delineate the precise boundaries of PI. The aims of this study were to measure ESE in normal controls and subjects with primary insomnia to establish the minimum amount of sleep needed for reliable subjective estimation and to depict the distribution of ESE in both groups. Method(s): A retrospective (study 1) and prospective (study 2) validation study was carried out. Study 1 included 288 normal subjects [176 females and 112 males, mean age 58.5 years, standard deviation (SD) 7.23]. Study 2 included 159 patients (98 females and 61 males; mean age 49.1 years, SD 12.71) with primary insomnia, diagnosed in according to the DSM-IV-TR criteria. Participants underwent a full- night polysomnographic study, followed by a morning assessment of subjective sleep parameters. A misperception index (MI) was computed using the following formula: MI = [objective total sleep time (oTST) - subjective total sleep time (sTST)]/oTST. The statistical properties of this index were analyzed in detail in both groups. Result(s): In controls, the Bland-Altman test demonstrated the reliability of MI for values of oTST >120 min. Healthy subjects estimated their sleep time correctly. Subjects with primary insomnia largely underestimated it. Statistical analysis of the distribution of MI in insomnia patients disclosed the presence of two subgroups, one with moderate sleep misperception (MM, 132 patients, MI<0.9) and the other with high sleep misperception (HM, 27 patients, MI>=0.9). The group with HM presents statistical properties different from group with MM and from normal subjects. The two subgroups of insomniacs present similar polysomnographic parameters except for TST and number of awakenings. Conclusion(s): The application of MI supports the existence of a subgroup of highly misperceptive insomniacs, different from other forms of insomnia. It has been possible to establish a minimum resolution power in sleep estimation for healthy subjects and a numerical threshold which might be considered as a supportive criterion for the diagnosis of PI. MI is easy to use and suitable for clinical and research purposes.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,*sleep;*insomnia;*society;patient;sleep time;normal human;female;male;arousal;reliability;validation study;night;statistical analysis;sleep parameters;diagnosis;Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders,,,,Tracing the polysomnographic borders of sleep misperception in primary insomnia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Result(s): Sleep latency was overestimated in 86 % of the insomnia patients, in 90 % of the sleep apnoea group and in 88 % of the patients with disturbing motor activity. In the sleep apnoea and motor disturbance groups, 75 % of the patients underestimated their total sleep time, compared to 80 % in the insomnia group. Conclusion(s): These findings indicate that sleep time misperceptions are common in different sleep disorders. Although insomnia patients have more pronounced discrepancies, overestimation of sleep latency and underestimation of total sleep time is also frequent in patients with sleep apnoea syndrome and in patients with motor disturbances during sleep.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,adolescent;adult;aged;apnea monitoring;bruxism;controlled study;diagnosis;doctor patient relation;human;*insomnia;major clinical study;motor activity;periodic limb movement disorder;questionnaire;sleep disordered breathing;*sleep time;Sleep Disorders;Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders,,,,Are sleep diaries reliable in patients with sleep disorders other than insomnia?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the majority of the previous studies used self-reported SD. It is unclear, however, the magnitude and the factors associated with SD misperceptions that may potentially limited the utility of using subjective SD. Aim(s): To evaluate the frequency and predictors of Sleep Duration (SD) misperceptions in a large cohort of participants not referred to sleep laboratories. Method(s): Participants from the ELSA-Brasil study underwent clinical and sleep evaluation (including mean subjective SD and wrist actigraphy for 7 days). We considered a signifcant SD underestimation (underSD) and overestimation (overSD) when the differences between subjective and objective SD reached at least -1 hour/+1-hour, respectively. The Bland-Altman method and Pearson correlation coeffcients (r) were assessed for exploring potential bias and agreement between the self-reported and actigraphy data. We used logistic regression analyses for identifying characteristics associated with SD misperceptions. Result(s): Data from 2,036 participants were used in the fnal analysis (42.7% males; mean age: 49+/-8 years). Subjective SD revealed poor correlations and low agreement with objective SD. The overall frequency of signifcant SD misperceptions was 39.1% (underSD: 19.4%; overSD: 19.7%). The predictors of underSD included: black race (OR: 1.88; 95% CI: 1.35, 2.64), mixed race (OR: 1.57; 95% CI: 1.18-2.09); excessive daytime sleepiness (OR: 1.46; 95% CI: 1.12-1.91); longer wake time after sleep onset time, WASO (OR: 2.38; 95% CI: 1.34-4.26), and longer objective SD (OR: 2.98; 95% CI: 2.52-3.52). Longer WASO (OR: 2.24; 95% CI: 1.33-3.79), and higher number of awakenings (OR: 1.02; 95% CI: 1.00-1.03) were independently associated with overSD. Interestingly, married status, high education levels and higher sleep effciency were associated with good SD perceptions. Conclusion(s): Subjective has poor correlations and agreement with objective measurements of SD contributing to a signifcant rate of SD misperceptions. While underSD was more associated with black/mixed race, daytime sleepiness, longer SD and WASO, overSD was specifcally associated with markers of sleep fragmentation. Considering the available technology, these results underscore the need for stopping the use of subjective data for SD defnitions.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,actimetry;adult;arousal;Black person;*Brazil;clinical evaluation;cohort analysis;conference abstract;controlled study;daytime somnolence;education;female;human;intermethod comparison;major clinical study;male;married person;middle aged;perception;*sleep time;stage 1 sleep;wrist;Sleep,,,,"Frequency and predictors of sleep duration misperceptions: Data from 2,036 participants from the ELSA-Brasil study",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Schinkelshoek, Neurology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, Netherlands","Objectives/Introduction: Sleep-state misperception is a common phenomenon among primary insomnia patients with a prevalence ranging between 9.2 and 50%. In obstructive sleep apnea, inverse sleep-state misperception has been reported. These studies depend on polysomnography measures for the identification of sleep-state misperception and predicting patient-related factors. We assessed factors influencing sleep-state perception during the 20-min naps of a multiple sleep latency test. Method(s): In this prospective observational study, 247 consecutive patients undergoing a routine multiple sleep latency test between March 2014 and October 2017 in SEIN Heemstede, a tertiary sleepwake centre in the Netherlands, were included. Sleep and dream perception was assessed by questionnaires after each nap. Mixed models were applied to assess the influence of patients' clinical data on sleep-state and dream perception. Result(s): Patients fell asleep in 82.3% of nap opportunities. Patients reported to have slept in 72.8%. A lower age (beta = -0.042/years +/- 0.017; p = 0.014), the occurrence of N2 stage sleep (beta = 2.106 +/- 0.842; p = 0.012) and a shorter sleep onset latency (beta = -0.225/min +/- 0.052; p < 0.001) were significant predictors for correct sleep-state perception. Sleep diagnosis did not predict correct sleep-state perception (p = 0.575). In 28.0% of naps in which patients did not reach REM sleep, patients reported to have dreamed. On the contrary, patients reported not to have dreamed in 26.4% of naps in which REM sleep did occur. Dream perception percentage was not significantly different between diagnosis categories. Conclusion(s): Sleep-state perception is better in younger patients with shorter sleep onset latencies during a nap in which N2 sleep occurred. Sleep-state perception does not differ between sleep diagnosis categories during the short naps of the multiple sleep latency test. Notably, the perception of dreaming is influenced by, but definitely not limited to the occurrence of REM sleep.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,adult;controlled study;diagnosis;*dreaming;female;human;major clinical study;male;Netherlands;observational study;*perception;prospective study;questionnaire;REM sleep;*sleep disorder;sleep latency;conference abstract;Sleep Disorders;Dreams,,,,Sleep-state and dream perception in sleep disorders,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Schwarz, Stockholm University, Stress Research Institute, Stockholm, Sweden","Introduction. The aim of the present analyses was to investigate the association of sleep length misperception with subjective sleep quality and objective sleep length in a large sample of women. Methods. Ambulant PSG recordings were obtained in one occasion in 400 non-pregnant women that were randomly selected from a representative sample (oversampling of snorers). The present analyses included 248 women (mean age + SD: 49.4 + 11.3 years) with complete data. Sleep length misperception was defined as total sleep time (PSG) - self-rated sleep length. Subjective sleep quality was rated on a visual analogue scale the morning after the recording. Results. The average absolute sleep length misperception was 44.8 min (SD=44.4 min). Multiple regression analyses indicated that subjective sleep quality (cubic polynomials) and objective sleep duration significantly contributed to explaining variance in sleep length misperception. Very good sleep quality was associated to a slight overestimation of sleep length, whereas low sleep quality was associated to a pronounced underestimation of sleep length. Women reporting medium sleep quality displayed a less biased sleep length estimate. Increased objective total sleep time was associated to sleep length underestimation. Similar results were obtained when adjusting for age and apnea-hypopnea index in the analyses. Conclusions. The results indicate that sleep length misperception is significantly related to perceived sleep quality for the respective night in a large sample of women. Moreover, in line with previous results we found that sleep time underestimation was increased in women with longer objective sleep duration. Future analyses will address the role of sleep characteristics, such as for instance awakenings, and psychological background variables.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,*sleep;*sleep quality;*female;*human;*sleep time;recording;visual analog scale;pregnant woman;arousal;night;apnea hypopnea index;multiple regression;Sleep,,,,Sleep length misperception and its association to subjective sleep quality and objective sleep duration in a large sample of women,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, few studies report minority parental perceptions of their children's sleep patterns. Our goal was to examine sleep patterns and determine the accuracy of parent reports of sleep compared with actigraphy in a community sample of 5-6 year old Latino and African American children. Method(s): Parents of healthy children were recruited from 5 primary care clinics. We used Actiwatch-2 devices (Respironics/Minimitter, Bend, OR) to objectively measure sleep duration, the Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ), a validated instrument to screen for childhood sleep problems, and parental sleep logs (SL). We compared results from actigraphy with self-reported data from parents. We enrolled 95 children with sleep problems, indicated by a score of >= 41 on the CSHQ, who wore the Actiwatch continuously for 7 nights and collected SL data for the nights of actigraphy monitoring. Result(s): Children's average bedtime by actigraphy was 10:22 pm +/- 1 hour and their average nightly SD was 8 hours 27 minutes +/-38 minutes (National Sleep Foundation recommends 10-11 hours of sleep for this age group). Parents reported an average bedtime of 9:22 PM +/- 1 hour 5 minutes on the CSHQ and average bedtime on SLs was 9:33 pm +/- 56 minutes, approximately 1 hour earlier than actigraphy. Parental SL records indicated average SD was 9 hours 36 minutes +/- 47 minutes. Compared to actigraphy, parents significantly overestimated nightly SD on average by 1 hour and 10 minutes +/-43 minutes (p<.001). Higher scores on the bedtime resistance CSHQ subscale were associated with shorter nightly SD (p=.01), but neither total CSHQ scores nor other subscale scores were linked to SD. Later bedtimes significantly reduced SD (p<.001) however later wake times did not significantly affect SD (p=.68). Conclusion(s): These results suggest that average nightly SD in these children is more than 1 1/2 hours shorter than recommended for 5-6 year old children. These findings are important because shortened SD adversely affects neurocognitive development, behavior, and health outcomes at a critical period when these children are starting school. Parents overestimated their children's SD by over an hour. The link between bedtime resistance and SD may be an important marker of sleep deficits in this population.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,*child;*human;*sleep time;*monitoring;*parent;*American;*society;*school;sleep;actimetry;sleep pattern;night;health;population;habit;hospital;learning;primary medical care;African American;Hispanic;devices;risk factor;questionnaire;groups by age;non profit organization;childhood;community sample;community;marker,,,,"Urban, early school-aged minority children have significantly shortened nightly sleep duration: Objective monitoring vs. parent report",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, in some sleep disorders with insomnia and in sleep breathing disorder, there were some discrepancies between perceived and measured sleep. Objective(s): To assess the accuracy of subjective perception about the previous night's sleep and the factors affecting this perception. To this end we analyzed overnight polysomnography and asked subjects undergoing polysomnography about their subjective perception of sleep. Method(s): We evaluated 175 patients who underwent overnight polysomnography. We assessed the habitual sleep pattern (total sleep time and sleep latency and awakening frequency during sleep) using a one week sleep log and several sleep questionnaires, such as Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Stanford Sleepiness Scale (SSS), Beck depression inventory (BDI), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). After overnight polysomnography, we asked for their subjective perception of sleep latency and total sleep time during the previous night sleep. Result(s): Mean subjective sleep latency (SSL) was 29+/-35.1 minutes, subjective total sleep time (STST) 284+/-102.4 minutes, whereas objective sleep latency (OSL) and objective total sleep time (OTST), as with overnight polysomnography were 11.4+/-19.1 and 320.5+/-50.7, respectively. Only 17 patients (9.7%) reported shorter SSL than OSL. SSL was correlated with OSL (p=0.001) and inversely associated with OTST (p=0.001) and STST (p=0.001). STST were significantly correlated with OTST and negatively with SSL. Comparing the group with longer SSL than OSL and the group with shorter SSL than OSL, there were no differences in SSS, ESS, ISI, PSQI, BDI, sleep architectures and sleep efficacy as calculated with overnight polysomnography. The group with shorter SSL than OSL had higher apnea-hypopnea index and arousal index and lower oxygen saturation than group with longer SSL than OSL. Comparing with STST and OTST, there were significantly lower sleep efficacy and higher waking time after sleep onset in the group with shorter STST and longer STST than OTST. Conclusion(s): This study suggests that the most patients perceive sleep latency and total sleep time to be longer than the objectively recorded sleep latency and total sleep time. The patients with obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome usually sense sleep latency to be shorter than it actually was.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,*sleep;sleep time;polysomnography;patient;insomnia;arousal;night sleep;sleep apnea syndrome;apnea hypopnea index;breathing disorder;wakefulness;Beck Depression Inventory;sleep disorder;sleep pattern;questionnaire;Epworth sleepiness scale;somnolence;architecture;oxygen saturation,,,,Accuracy of subjective sleep state perception,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PARTICIPANTS: 385 adolescents aged 13-18 years (X = 15.6, SD = 0.95; 60% male) from eight high schools in South Australia. MEASUREMENTS & METHODS: Adolescents completed the School Sleep Habits Survey and Paediatric Daytime Sleepiness Scale during class time, followed by an 8-day Sleep Diary and wrist actigraphy. The Flinders Fatigue Scale was completed on the final day of the study. Parents completed a Sleep, Medical, Education and Family History survey. RESULT(S): Actigraphic estimates of wake after sleep onset (WASO) were substantially greater than sleep diary estimates (74m actigraphy vs. 7m sleep diary) and conversely actigraphic estimates of sleep were substantially less than both sleep diary and parent-report (6h51m actigraphy vs. 8h16m sleep diary vs. 8h51m parent-report). Sleep diary estimates, but not actigraphy, displayed significant relationships with daytime functioning. Actigraphy showed weak relationships with concomitantly recorded sleep diary variables. Sex and puberty-related differences were found in actigraphic scoring. Actigraphy scored more WASO and less sleep in boys compared to girls, and more WASO amongst pubertally-mature boys than boys of less advanced pubertal development. CONCLUSION(S): There may be differences in the sleep of adolescents that result in less actigraphic total sleep scored than perceived, particularly in boys, possibly because of increased sleep motor activity in adolescents that actigraphic algorithms score as wake. This is a significant concern that requires further examination with PSG.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,*sleep;*human;*adolescent;actimetry;male;boy;parent;girl;motor activity;algorithm;high school;Australia;school;examination;daytime somnolence;wrist;female;fatigue;medical education;family history;puberty;habit;Adolescent,,,,The discrepancy between actigraphic and sleep diary measures of sleep in adolescents,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Simard, Universite de Sherbrooke, Canada","Introduction and Objectives: It has been suggested that felt security is a prerequisite to good sleep in children. Attachment theory offers a well-defined framework for investigating security in the parent-child relationship. Studies that have investigated child sleep in relation to attachment have yielded inconsistent findings, possibly due to methodological differences in sleep assessments (actigraphy versusmother reports). The objective of this study was to investigate the relation between child attachment and sleep quality using both actigraphy and maternal reports. Material(s) and Method(s): Fifty-two children (23 boys) aged 25 to 48 months taking part in a broader longitudinal study wore an actigraph (Mini-Mitter; Respironics, Oregon) for a 72-hour period. Data were analyzed using a high (80) sensitivity threshold. Then, nocturnal wake periods were smoothed following a validated procedure for reducing wake bouts/duration, artificially inflated by high motor activity in young children's sleep. A sleep diary was completed by mothers during actigraphic data collection. Attachment security was assessed (n=36) when children were 18 months with the Strange Situation procedure, which consists of a series of separations and reunions designed to trigger child attachment behaviours. Expert coders rated child behaviour on four scales (avoidance, proximity seeking, contact maintenance, resistance). Result(s): Actigaphy-derived sleep parameters were unrelated to attachment scores.However, better sleep (longer sleep duration, greater sleep efficiency) according to maternal reports was associated with more avoidance during the Strange Situation (r(36)=0.46 and 0.51, p<0.01). Overestimation of sleep quality by the mother (mother reports - actigraphy values) with respect to wake duration and sleep efficiency was related to increased child avoidance (r(36)=0.39 and 0.35, p<0.05). Conclusion(s): Mothers of avoidant children may be unreliable observers of their child's sleep quality, possibly because avoidant children do not manifest their distress at night. The present results suggest that parental reports of child sleep might be systematically biased in certain subgroups of the population.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,*human;*child;*sleep quality;*sleep;*female;*Canadian;*sleep medicine;*mother;*society;actimetry;procedures;male;sleep time;boy;sleep parameters;child behavior;child parent relation;Reunion;information processing;motor activity;United States;night;population;longitudinal study;Child;Only Child,,,,Overestimation of children's sleep quality by mothers of insecure-avoidant children,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast to Actigraphy, Self-Report asks an individual to report their perceived TST. SAFTE-FAST's Autosleep function estimates likely sleep times using prior sleep times, time of work, and length of time awake. We seek to determine whether Self-Report or Autosleep is more highly correlated with Actigraphy, recognizing that Actigraphy is currently the most accepted modality for measuring sleep in the field. Method(s): In this presentation, we compare Actigraphy, Self-Report, and Autosleep to generate SAFTE-FAST predicted effectiveness scores on a three-segment, overnight Guam (GUM) round trip to better understand how the modalities compare. Result(s): This study shows lower predicted effectiveness scores at fnal top of descent (TOD) as predicted by Actigraphy (M=70.07, SD=5.12), compared to Autosleep (M=74.34, SD=1.85) and Self-Report (M=73.19, SD=4.21). A strong correlation (r(20) = 0.748, p<0.000) was found between predicted effectiveness as measured by Actigraphy and Self-Report sleep data. No correlation was found between Actigraphy and Autosleep. Discussion(s): When comparing all modalities, it appears that both Autosleep and Self-Report may be overestimating predicted effectiveness scores. Since our results showed a strong correlation between Actigraphy and Self-Report, our recommendation is to use Self-Report when Actigraphy is unavailable.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,*actimetry;controlled study;Guam;*self report;sleep;conference abstract,,,,Modeling SAFTE-FAST predicted effectiveness at final top of descent: Actigraphy v. self report v.

Solverson, University of Calgary, Canada","Introduction Recent studies have suggested that critical illness survivors experience long-term sleep disruption [1,2]. The Actigraph device is a sleep watch that has been shown to have equivalent accuracy to polysomnography and previously used during critical illness to show sleep disruption [3]. Our objective was to assess patients long-term sleep quality using the Actigraph device. Methods Study patients were selected from a 24-bed multidisciplinary ICU. Thirteen patients who were >=18 years old, stayed longer than 4 days in the ICU and did not have and acute brain injury were followed up at 2 months post hospital discharge. The Actigraph device was given to patients to take home and worn for 72 hours. Previously validated algorithms were used to analyze sleep and wake cycles [4]. Additionally, patient completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PQSI), as a measure of subjective sleep quality. Results Sixty-two percent of patients at 2 months post hospital discharge reported poor sleep quality as per the PSQI. The Actigraph results showed patients' average total sleep time was 6.15 hours, with a sleep efficiency of 78%. The mean time to fall asleep was 12 minutes. Patients had an average of 11 awakenings per night and were awake for an average of 7 minutes during the awakenings. There were no associations found between patients' perceived sleep quality and total sleep, sleep efficiency or sleep disruptions. Patients' severity of illness, as measured by the APACHE II score, was statistically associated with lower total sleep time (beta = -12.6, P = 0.019), reduced sleep efficiency (beta = -1.18, P = 0.042) and higher number of sleep disruptions (beta = 0.64, P = 0.023). The number of days ventilated or ICU and hospital length of stay were not statistically associated with the Actigraph sleep parameters. Conclusion Survivors of critical illness have high levels of sleep dysfunction as measured by actigraphy. Patients' severity of illness while critically ill appears to increase the level of long-term sleep dysfunction experienced.

The International Pediatric Sleep Task Force highlighted the importance of examining cultural similarities and differences impacting sleep practices in children. The purpose of this pilot study was to describe the sleep behaviors and sleep quality in children, ages 7-9, (n = 14) participating in the Jintan China Health Project (n = 1650) and a cohort of children, ages 6-10, (n = 15) who participated in a larger crosssectional study from Philadelphia, US. Method(s): Measures: Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire(CSHQ), validated in Chinese population; Actigraphy: non-dominant wrist, Sadeh algorithm; Sleep diaries. Result(s): The weekly sleep diary was completed by all parents. Night time sleep duration for the China cohort was 558 minutes as compared to 600 minutes for the US cohort (P = 0.042). However, 79% of the parents of the China cohort reported that their child napped during the day. The US cohort did not nap. Forty percent of the US and 36% of the China cohorts scored above the cutoff on the CSHQ. Similar sleep problems were identified for both cohorts: bedtime resistance, sleep anxiety and daytime sleepiness. Four children in the China cohort were co-sleepers vs one child in the US cohort. Eighty five percent of the China cohort and 100% of the US cohort used actigraphy. Children in the China cohort were curious about the actigraph technology and opened the watch breaking the water seal. As a result, only five of the twelve sets of data were able to be analyzed. There was no significant differences (P = 0.144) in total sleep time as measured by actigraphy between the two cohorts. Discrepancies between diary and actigraphy data on napping behaviors in China cohort were found. Conclusion(s): Continuous actigraphy for seven days along with diary data are invaluable and feasible in both populations. Chinese parents may be overestimating napping behaviors at school.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,*sleep;*China;*child;*United States;*actimetry;*health care organization;*pilot study;*cultural factor;parent;population;questionnaire;wrist;night;anxiety;daytime somnolence;technology;sleep time;school;health;habit;algorithm;water;nitrogen 15;Pilot Projects;United States;Cross-Cultural Comparison,,,,A pilot study: Cross cultural comparison of actigraphy and parental report of sleep in children from China and United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PsyI present belownormative PSG values and an accurate perception of their sleep while ParI show normal PSG values and an underestimation of sleep. The objective of this study is to describe the distribution of INS's PSG sleep parameters and accuracy of sleep perception in order to test the validity of the actual PsyI/ParI classification. Method(s): Forty-six chronic INS (Mage = 42.4 years) underwent four consecutive PSG recording nights while completing sleep diaries each morning. From nights 2 and 3, subjective (S) and objective (O) sleep measures were computed (TST, SE) as well as difference scores (O-S; diffTST, diffSE). K-Means cluster analyses were performed with 2, 3 and 4 clusters using OTST, OSE, diffTST and diffSE as variables. Result(s): Based on cluster size, the 2-cluster model was retained. INS were classified on the basis of sleep perception: accurate (n=31; diffTST<82.0min, diffSE<18.2%) or overestimation of sleep difficulties (n=15; diffTST>102.7min, diffSE>22.0%). Between groups ANOVAs revealed significant differences in diffTST and diffSE (p<.001), but similar OTST and OSE (p>.05). It is noteworthy that the 3 and 4-clus- ter models both generated a small group (n=3) of poor sleepers (OTST =363.5min, OSE=75.7%) greatly overestimating their sleep difficulties (diffTST=279.0min, diffSE=59.7%). Conclusion(s): These results suggest that chronic insomnia sufferers who accurately perceive their sleep and those who show large objective- subjective differences might belong to different insomnia subtypes. Contrary to our expectations, this classification is obtained regardless of objective sleep difficulties. However, according to the 3 or 4-cluster models, some individuals, having objectively poor sleep and considerably underestimating their sleep time, may represent another, although rare, subtype of chronic insomnia. Further research shall be conducted to validate this classification (ex. using cortical activation).","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,*sleep;*classification;*insomnia;*recording;*laboratory;*health care organization;model;night;sleep parameters;cluster analysis;validity;sleep time;nitrogen 15;Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders,,,,CLassification of insomnia sufferers based on laboratory PSG recordings and subjective sleep reports,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies provide discordant information on the association between self-reported and objective TST with some finding weak or no correlations and bias in reporting based on sex and body mass index. Objective(s): Our goal was to investigate the correlation between self-reported and objective measures of TST in a diverse sample of adult men and women volunteering to participate in sleep studies and determine whether sex, race/ethnicity, and weight status influence this association. Method(s): Participants were individuals who screened for participation in sleep studies for whom we had >7 D of wrist actigraphy sleep data (TSTobj) and subjective total sleep time (TSTPSQI) reported using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire (n=53 men and 60 women; n=67 minority/Hispanics; age 30.9+/-9.7y; BMI 26.2+/-3.2kg/m2). Result(s): Average TSTPSQI was greater than TSTobj (0.63+/-0.99h, p<0.0001). In univariate regression analyses, the difference between TSTPSQI and TSTobj did not vary by sex (s=0.12, p=0.52), race/ethnicity (s=0.15, p=0.48), age (s=-0.01, p=0.27), or BMI (s=0.04, p=0.13). Overall, there was no correlation between TSTobj and TSTPSQI (r=0.12, p=0.22), which did not vary when sex was analyzed separately (men: r=0.20, p=0.15; women: r=0.046, p=0.73). Interestingly, there were moderate and highly significant correlations between self-reported and objective assessments of bedtime (r=0.42, p<0.0001) and wake time (r=0.35, p<0.0001). We therefore used bedtime, waketime, and time to fall asleep information on the PSQI to calculate a new TSTbed/wake. Average TSTbed/wake was greater than TSTobj (0.79+/-0.76h, p<0.0001). This measure was correlated with TSTobj (r=0.57, p<0.0001); with strong correlation in women (r=0.76, p<0.0001) and moderate correlation in men (r=0.36, p=0.0082). In univariate regression, the difference between TSTbed/wake and TSTobj varied by age (s=-0.020, p=0.0051), BMI (s=0.054, p=0.0021), race/ethnicity (s=0.36, p=0.021), and sleep efficiency (s=-0.089, p<0.0001). Conclusion(s): Self-reported bedtimes and wake times were more accurately reported than estimated TSTPSQI and provided a more reliable estimate of TST. In general, the degree of over-reporting was greater in younger and heavier individuals, non-White/Hispanics, and those with low sleep efficiency. Although self-reported assessments of sleep duration over-estimated objective measures by approximately 45 min, using information on habitual bedtimes, wake times, and time to fall asleep improved the relation in both men and women.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,actimetry;adult;body mass;ethnicity;female;human;human experiment;human tissue;major clinical study;male;Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index;questionnaire;race;regression analysis;*sleep quality;sleep time;wrist;conference abstract;Wakefulness,,,,Information on bedtimes and wake times improves the relation between self-reported and objective assessments of sleep in adults,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this study was to trial a behavioural educational sleep intervention for first time mothers, aimed at promoting mother and infant sleep in the first 12-wks postpartum. Analyses were conducted to 1) determine how accurate self-reported total sleep time in 24 hrs (TST) is compared to objectively measured TST, 2) investigate if accuracy differs by level of sleep education. Method(s): Forty first-time mothers (mean age 33.32 yrs, SD = 2.84), participated in the Parent Information on Parent & Infant Sleep study. Control group mothers (CGM), n = 20, attended a short, prenatal, general information session and received two contact-only telephone calls at 2 and 4 wks postpartum. Intervention group mothers (IGM), n = 20, attended a 2-hour prenatal sleep education session and received weekly support calls in the first 6 wks postpartum. Self-reported TST was collected from a health and sleep habits questionnaire at 12 wks postpartum. Actigraphy and sleep diaries (48 hrs) were completed for all mother-infant pairs at 12 wks postpartum (mean infant gestational age 52.1 wks, SD = 1.52). Mean actigraphic TST in 24 hrs was calculated and t-tests were used for all analyses. Result(s): At 12 wks postpartum CGM mean self-reported TST was 461 mins compared to mean 413 mins as measured by actigraphy (+48 mins, t(19) = -2.29, p = 0.03). IGM mean self-reported TST in 24 hours was 428 mins compared to 420 mins using acti-graphy (+8 mins, t(19) = -0.588, p = 0.56). Fifty percent of CGM overestimated TST by >30 mins whereas only 30% of IGM made the same level of over-estimation (35% and 15% respectively overestimated by >60 mins). Further analysis showed that the extent of over-estimation was not significantly different between these two groups (t(36) = 1.73, p = 0.09). Conclusion(s): Women in this study who received prenatal education, including information about realistic postpartum sleep patterns, showed a tendency to more accurately self-report actual TST compared to those who received no formal sleep education. The effect of surmised selfreport biases (such as being seen to sleep well) and the contribution of sleep education to these findings warrant further investigation in a larger sample of peripartum women.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,*sleep;*sleep time;*human;*female;*education;mother;infant;parent;actimetry;self report;sleep pattern;telephone;Student t test;gestational age;questionnaire;habit;health;control group,,,,Differences in accuracy of selfreported sleep duration between women who receive prenatal sleep education and those who do not,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the majority of the existing literature is limited by primarily subjective measures of sleep. To examine the possibility of paradoxical insomnia, we conducted preliminary analyses between women with chronic migraine (CM) and healthy controls (HC) on self-report measures and polysomnography (PSG). Method(s): Fifteen women with CM (mean age = 33 years) and 11 HC women (mean age = 30 years) completed an overnight laboratory PSG with a fixed 8-hour time in bed and several headache and sleep-related measures, including sleep diaries. Difference scores were calculated for sleep parameters by subtracting PSG from sleep diary data corresponding to the PSG night. CM and HC were compared using parametric (t-test) and non-parametric tests (Mann-Whitney) on PSG, sleep diaries, difference scores, and other measures of insomnia symptoms. Result(s): No significant differences were found between individuals with CM and HC on PSG or sleep diary measures of sleep parameters. However, a Mann-Whitney test revealed a significant difference (p < 0.05) between CM and HC on total sleep time (TST) difference score (diaries-PSG), with CM underestimating TST (median = -14.5 minutes) and HC overestimating TST (median = +10 minutes). Compared to HC, CM also reported significantly higher scores (p < 0.05) on the Insomnia Severity Index, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Fatigue Severity Scale, Pre-Sleep Arousal Scale, and Migraine Disability Assessment. Conclusion(s): These preliminary results indicate a relative difference between women with CM and HC on the accuracy of sleep-diary estimated TST compared to PSG-derived TST, despite similar sleep parameters. On self-report measures, women with CM report global insomnia symptoms and daytime dysfunction that are consistent with an insomnia disorder. The subjective/objective discrepancy raises the possibility that paradoxical insomnia may be more prevalent in women with CM.

Little is known about the concordance between subjective and objective measures of sleep among individuals with alcohol dependence, who experience higher rates of sleep disturbance compared to the general population. Method(s): Data were collected from a cohort of patients (n=164) enrolled on an inpatient alcohol treatment program. Both objective (actigraphy) and subjective (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index-PSQI and daily diaries) measures of sleep quantity and quality were collected. PSQI assessments from day 28 of inpatient treatment and the first four weeks average actigraphy sleep duration and efficiency were compared using a paired t-test. Sleep efficiency was calculated by dividing total sleep duration by the total time spent in bed during major rest intervals. Result(s): Of the 96 patients included in this analysis, the majority were male (66.7%), non-Hispanic (95.8%), and African American (51%). Self-reported sleep duration (6.17 hrs +/- 1.47) was significantly (p < 0.0001) longer than actigraphy recorded sleep duration (5.17 hrs +/- 1.17).

We assessed how subjective and objective sleep changes during the first year of treatment for women with BCa. Further, we examined whether this differs between previously good and poor sleepers and whether there was agreement between subjective and objective measures of sleep. Method(s): Sleep onset latency (SOL), wake after sleep onset (WASO), total sleep time (TST), and sleep efficiency (SE) were measured among 100 patients with newly diagnosed, nonmetastatic BCa using 7 days of diary and actigraphy collected at 4 time points: pre-treatment, 4, 8, and 12 months. Women with a score >=5 on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index at treatment onset were classified as poor sleepers. A 4 (time: 0-, 4-, 8-, 12-months) by 2 (sleep measure: sleep diary, actigraphy) by 2 (group: good, poor sleepers) mixed model ANOVAs was performed for each sleep parameter. Result(s): There was a time by sleep measure by group interaction for TST, [F(3,294)= 3.014, p = .03). Good sleepers reported greater TST on diaries- than actigraphy at pre-treatment and 12 months, whereas there were no differences in poor sleepers. There was a group by time effect for good vs. poor sleepers [F(3,294)= 2.909, p = .035]. Good sleepers experienced decreased TST and SE from pre-treatment through 4-mo, followed by increases. Poor sleepers showed the opposite pattern. Neither group returned to pretreatment levels. Sleep diaries and actigraphy are concordant over time for TST, but not SOL, WASO, or SE.

Based on these subjective complaints, treatment often involves hypnotic and/or anxiolytic medications with disturbing side effects that increase patients' drug load. Most hypnosedatives are prescribed based on subjective complaints, but little information is published on the relationship between self-report and recorded sleep in this population. Objective(s): The present study examined the correlation between subjective and objective evaluation of sleep measures among schizophrenia patients compared with age- and gender-matched controls. Method(s): The sample comprised two groups: 30 schizophrenia patients (mean age=48.50, SD=12.45; 17 M, 13 F) and 30 age- and gender-matched controls (mean age= 48.56, SD=12.54; 17 M, 13 F). Subjects subjectively evaluated their sleep patterns using two qualitative reports-the Mini Sleep Questionnaire (MSQ), and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and one quantitative report-the Technion Sleep Questionnaire (TSQ). Additionally, subjects' sleep was continuously monitored for a week with a wrist actigraph (Ambulatory Monitoring, Inc.). Result(s): Analysis revealed no significant correlations between subjective and objective measures of sleep in all participants. Interestingly, significant interactions were found between estimation type of the discrepancy (overestimate vs. underestimate) and schizophrenia existence (schizophrenia patients vs. controls) on discrepancy of sleep efficiency [F(1,51)=6.2, p<0.05], sleep percentage [F(1,54)=8.86, p<0.01] and minutes of wake after sleep onset [F(1,51)=9.24, p<0.01]; meaning that schizophrenia patients display greater discrepancies than controls. Conclusion(s): The findings indicate that subjective reports among schizophrenia patients are unreliable, and argue for objectively evaluating sleep in this population before prescribing sleep medications.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,*sleep;*human;*patient;*European;*schizophrenia;*psychiatry;questionnaire;gender;drug therapy;population;self report;ambulatory monitoring;wrist;Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index;side effect;sleep pattern;sleep disorder;anxiolytic agent;hypnotic agent;Sleep,,,,Sleep in schizophrenic patients: Discrepancy between self-reported versus recorded sleep,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Longitudinal studies provide an avenue to understand direct relationships between naturalistic sleep and fluctuations in human health and performance. Method(s): The present study used wrist actigraphy and sleep log diaries to obtain daily measurements of sleep-related variables from 30 healthy adults for up to 16 consecutive weeks. We used non-parametric Bland-Altman analysis and correlation coefficients to calculate agreement between variables including sleep onset time, sleep offset time, sleep onset latency, number of awakenings, wake after sleep onset, and total sleep time. To better understand individual variability, we examined compliance data on the submission of daily sleep logs as well as performance data across several diverse cognitive tasks. Result(s): Overall, we found strong agreement for sleep onset and sleep offset times, but relatively poor agreement for variables related to night wakefulness. Compliance tended to decrease significantly over time according to a linear function, but there were also substantial individual differences in compliance that could help explain variability in agreement. Individuals who were consistently more compliant over time also tended to show the best agreement between objective measures and self-report. Individual variability in sleep onset time often revealed the strongest relationship with differences in task performance. Conclusion(s): These results demonstrate convergent validity in measuring sleep onset and sleep offset times with actigraphy/sleep logs across several months in a natural environment, but also recommend caution interpreting variables related to night wakefulness and self-report data from individuals showing relatively poor compliance.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,*actimetry;adult;arousal;clinical article;controlled study;convergent validity;correlation coefficient;female;human;human experiment;*longitudinal study;male;self report;sleep latency;*sleep time;task performance;wakefulness;*wrist;conference abstract;Longitudinal Studies,,,,Individual differences in sleep log compliance and agreement with wrist actigraphy: A longitudinal study of naturalistic sleep in healthy adults,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hypnotic drugs are often used as solution to insomnia because of their positive effects on sleep. However, hypnotic drugs can also be associated with cognitive impairments, especially in elderly people. This study examined the effects of hypnotic drugs on subjective and objective sleep measures and also on vigilance. Material(s) and Method(s): Eighteen participants with amean age of 69.3 years old (SD=6.8) complaining of sleep maintenance insomnia (9 hypnotics users, 9 non-users) were matched for age and gender. Participants had to sleep 3 consecutive nights in laboratory for polysomnographic (PSG) recording and complete a sleep diary. Vigilance was evaluated upon awakening in the morning using an event-related potentials (ERPs) oddball paradigm. Result(s): Group comparison revealed no significant difference between them in PSG measures except in the percentage of time spent awake during the night which was lower for hypnotics users compared to non-users (11.6% vs 23.4%, p<0.05). While the subjective evaluation of sleep efficiency for the third night in laboratory was similar for both groups (hypnotics users = 72.4% and non-users = 73.5%) there was a significant difference (p<0.05) between their perception and the PSG measures which showed a higher efficiency for hypnotics users (82.6%) compared to non-users (74.3%). At the vigilance task, hypnotics users showed a significantly longer latency to the P3 component than the non-users (p<0.05). Conclusion(s): As expected, hypnotics uptake provoked a decrease of wakefulness during the night. However, users still underestimate these effects since subjective evaluation of sleep efficiency was much lower than what PSG revealed. Moreover, the use of hypnotic drugs in these elderly individuals did also affect the information processing underlying the act of decision making as measured by the P3 component of the ERP task in the morning.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,*sleep;*aged;*alertness;*human;*sleep medicine;*Canadian;*society;night;insomnia;laboratory;information processing;cognitive defect;gender;wakefulness;latent period;event related potential;aging;arousal;recording;decision making;sleep disorder;health;*hypnotic agent;Hypnotics and Sedatives,,,,Effects of hypnotics on sleep and vigilance in elderly people,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Watson, Neurology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, United States","Introduction: Short sleep is associated with the activation of pro-inlammatory cytokines and inlammatory states such as obesity. Co-twin study methodologies are advantageous as they account for familial (e.g., genetics and shared environmental) confounding, allowing assessment of subtle environmental effects, such as the effect of short habitual sleep duration on serum cytokine levels. Therefore, we sought to investigate cytokines in monozygotic twins discordant for actigraphy phenotyped habitual sleep duration. Method(s): Sixteen monozygotic twin pairs (81% female, mean age 40.3 [SD=17.2] years), selected by subjective habitual sleep duration discordance of at least one hour per 24 hours, were phenotyped for habitual objective sleep duration with two weeks of actigraphy. Fasting blood samples were obtained in the morning of the inal day of actigraphic measurement and assayed with Luminex multi-analyte proiling beads. Within-pair 24 hour sleep duration discordance was the independent variable, within-pair cytokine difference the dependent variable. Analysis included linear regression with robust standard error estimates. Results are presented as Pearson's correlation coeficients. Result(s): For the total twin sample, mean 24-hour sleep duration was 444.8 minutes (SD=53.6 minutes; range 325.4 - 553.2 minutes). Mean within-pair 24 hour sleep duration discordance was 72.2 minutes (SD=28.1; range 45.9 - 137.1 minutes). IL-1 alpha levels correlated with 24 hour within-pair sleep duration discordance (r=0.55; p=0.03), with correlative trends observed for sIL-6 receptor (r=0.47; p=0.07), IL-10 (r=0.41; p=0.11), IL-6 (r=0.38; p=0.15), and IL-1 receptor antagonist (r=0.37; p=0.16) levels. Sleep duration discordance did not correlate with other inlammatory measures including TNF-alpha, C-reactive protein, and VCAM1. Conclusion(s): By accounting for familial (e.g., genetic and shared environmental) confounding and measuring real life habitual sleep duration, our study suggests a complicated interplay of pro and anti-inlammatory mediators in shorter sleeping twins in (what may be considered) immunologically ""compensated"" sleep deprivation due to the habitual, and not experimental, nature of the sleep duration phenotype.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,"*sleep;*monozygotic twins;*sleep time;*organization;*inflammation;twins;actimetry;genetics;dependent variable;methodology;blood sampling;diet restriction;obesity;phenotype;independent variable;linear regression analysis;female;serum;sleep deprivation;cytokine;receptor;interleukin 1alpha;tumor necrosis factor alpha;interleukin 1;interleukin 6;interleukin 10;C reactive protein;Habituation, Psychophysiologic;Inflammation;Twins;Sleep",,,,Inflammation in monozygotic twins discordant for habitual sleep duration,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Weinberger, Winthrop University Hospital, Brooklyn, NY, United States","PURPOSE: The clinical diagnosis of insomnia rests almost entirely on a patient's subjective reporting of difficulty initiating or difficulty maintaining sleep. Paradoxical insomnia, or sleep-state misperception, refers to a situation where the patient's perception of insomnia does not correspond to reality; the patient's subjective assessment of sleep is less than the objective measurement thereof. Theoretically, many factors could contribute to this misperception, including gender, age and various sleep disorders. In this study we investigated the relationship of self-reported sleep perceptions to objective sleep measures in children and adults undergoing an in-lab polysomnography (PSG). METHOD(S): Objective measures of total sleep time (TST) and sleep latency (SL) were compared to subjective patient reports. Age, gender, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD) were hypothesized to affect sleep perception. Patients (ages 12 to 85) who underwent polysomnography at our sleep center during a three month period were selected. A questionnaire at the study's conclusion was answered to subjectively quantify TST and SL. This was compared to objective measures of sleep parameters on PSG. OSA and PLMD were quantified based on the event index (AHI and PLMI, respectively). Differences between subjective and objective TST and SL were computed and their means were compared by gender, age, AHI and PLMI. Group comparisons with ANOVA testing were performed. RESULT(S): A total of 211 patients were studied. The numbers of males and females were approximately equal. The mean age was 48 years. The biggest difference in TST was observed in the 12-20 years age group, but it was not statistically significant (p-value 0.5). No significant difference in TST or SL were observed with OSA (p-value 0.68, 0.92 respectively). A significant difference in TST was observed in females (p-value 0.02) and with the presence of PLMD (p-value 0.0173). CONCLUSION(S): In conclusion, this study suggests that (i) the presence of PLMD may contribute to sleep state misperception and (ii) females are more susceptible to sleep state misperception. Although the younger age population did seem to have a propensity towards sleep state this was not found to be statistically significant. OSA was also not found to contribute to sleep state misperception. This study has several limitations. First, the study did not account for confounding factors such as underlying medical conditions or medications that patients were taking were not examined. Second, the relatively small sample size may have underpowered the study's results.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,adolescent;adult;aged;analysis of variance;apnea monitoring;child;female;*gender;human;major clinical study;male;middle aged;participant observation;*perception;*periodic limb movement disorder;polysomnography;quantitative study;questionnaire;sample size;sleep disordered breathing;*sleep time;statistical significance;Sleep Disorders;Sleep,,,,"Sleep state perception: Effects of age, gender, and co-existing sleep disorders",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A careful evaluation of sleep patterns is essential in clinical practice. Recently, we provided data about the interchangeable use of actigraphy, diary and questionnaire for the assessment of sleep patterns in healthy children (Werner, 2008). However, it remains unclear how well actigraphy and diary also agree in sleepdisordered, young children. Method(s): A total of 42 sleep-disordered children (age range 6- 47 months) who came for out-patient sleep consultations were included. Sleep patterns were assessed by actigraphy and diary. Sleep patterns were identically defined as in Werner et al. (2008). The degree of agreement between methods was quantified using the 95% limits of agreement of Bland and Altman (1986). Result(s): Parents reported bedtime struggles in 62% of the children, and night awakenings in 95%. Differences between methods were smallest for sleep start (+/- 25 min), sleep end (+/- 26 min), and assumed sleep (+/- 35 min). For actual sleep time, day-time sleep duration and 24-h sleep duration, differences were +/- 97 min, +/- 49 min, and +/- 60 min, respectively. Conclusion(s): On the basis of our clinical experience, we defined the agreement between methods as acceptable if differences were smaller than 30 min. This condition was satisfied for sleep start, sleep end, and assumed sleep, while for actual sleep duration and day-time sleep, it was not. Our findings suggest that at least for sleep start, sleep end and assumed sleep, the diary is a satisfactory method for the assessment of sleep patterns in sleep-disordered, young children.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,*sleep;*human;*clinical practice;*society;*child;sleep pattern;sleep time;actimetry;consultation;outpatient;questionnaire;arousal;night;parent;childhood;Only Child;Child,,,,Valid methods for the estimation of children's sleep problems in clinical practice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is likely that in this group, as found in the general population, self-report sleep quality is unreliable. This study compares self-reported sleep quality with objective measures on polysomnography (PSG) during pregnancy. Method(s): Twenty-one women in the third trimester (T3) and 17 women in the first trimester (T1) of pregnancy and 10 non-pregnant controls underwent overnight PSG and reported their perceived sleep onset latency (SOL), total sleep time (TST) and sleep quality. Result(s): (Table presented) On average, all groups overestimated their SOL. The T3 group tended to overestimate TST, which differed significantly from the T1 and control groups who underestimated TST on average. Absolute values however show that all groups incorrectly reported TST by 40-50 minutes with substantial variability. The accuracy of sleep perception did not differ between those who reported their sleep quality as the same as usual or worse than usual. Discussion(s): Sleep perception during pregnancy tends to be unreliable, but not significantly more so than in healthy controls. Negative perceptions of sleep quality regardless of objective measures have been shown to result in impaired daytime functioning. Misperception of sleep also has important implications for the vast number of studies based on self-report in the pregnant population.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,*sleep;*pregnancy;*biodiversity;female;population;self report;night;sleep disorder;control group;polysomnography;third trimester pregnancy;first trimester pregnancy;latent period;sleep time;laboratory;Pregnancy,,,,Misperception of sleep latency and sleep duration in pregnancy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We aimed to investigate how common sleep misperception is in Parkinson patients. Method(s): We examined polysomnographic records from 27 Parkinson patients and 27 controls (matched for age and sex) from a database of sleep recordings from 2008-2018. We collected Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores and objective sleep parameters including: total sleep time (TST), sleep latency (SL), sleep efficiency (SE), AHI, PLM index. We also collected data from post study morning questionnaires including: subjective total sleep time, estimation of number and length of awakenings, and subjective sleep latency. The student t test was used to examine group differences. Result(s): The two groups were not significantly different with respect to TST, SE, SL, AHI, PLMI, or Epworth score. We found twice as many Parkinson patients (6 versus 3 control patients) met criteria for underestimating their sleep time (defined by 120 minutes difference in subjective versus objective times), but misperception was not statistically significant between the entire group of 27 pairs. On review of individual data, it was observed that Parkinson patients appeared to have more severe sleep misperception. Thus analysis of the lower half of the misperception Parkinson patient group was compared to the lower half of misperception patients in the control cohort. In this analysis, the Parkinson patients had greater underestimation of total sleep time, as well as a lower BMI (both p<0.05), and a trend to lower AHI (p<0.1). The Parkinson patients (n=13) and control subjects (n=13) were not different for TST, SE, SL or PLMI, or degree of subjective sleepiness. Conclusion(s): In our cohort we found that Parkinson patients had more severe sleep misperception than controls; however they were not different with respect to other objective parameters or their degree of sleepiness. This suggests their misperception may be related to an altered experience of sleep continuity. Further studies are needed to investigate sleep misperception in Parkinson's patients.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,adult;arousal;body mass;clinical article;cohort analysis;controlled study;Epworth sleepiness scale;female;human;male;*Parkinson disease;questionnaire;sleep latency;*sleep quality;sleep time;*time perception;conference abstract,,,,Sleep perception in Parkinson patients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite the high prevalence of insomnia symptoms, validation of insomnia assessment tools has been lagging in this clinical group. The Consensus Sleep Diary (CSD) was developed to provide a standard sleep log based on patients' input and expert consensus (Carney, 2012). We have conducted a comprehensive sleep and circadian assessment in a consecutive sample of patients suffering from chronic post-concussion insomnia. As part of this study, we examined the acceptability and psychometric properties of the CSD in this clinical group. Material(s) and Method(s): Individuals reporting ICSD-3 and DSM-5 symptoms of chronic insomnia (N = 50; 64% females; mean age = 39) participated 3-24 months following a concussion. Participants monitored their sleep for two consecutive weeks with the CSD and a Philips Respironics Actiwatch 2, set to record 30 s epochs at medium sensitivity. One night of sleep was recorded and manually scored in the sleep laboratory. Additionally, participants recorded two nights of sleep in their homes using a Compumedics PSG device. Home recordings were scored automatically with NeuroZone software and manually for quality control purposes. Result(s): Most (88%) of participants completed the sleep diary and rated this assessment as ""3 = acceptable"" on a 0-4 scale ranging from ""extremely burdensome"" to ""highly acceptable"". Eighty eight percent of these individuals had a sleep diary sleep efficiency (SE) < 85%. There were significant correlations between two weeks average sleep diary and actigraphy total sleep time (TST), while correlations between the wake indices and SE were weak and non-significant. CSD and PSG sleep onset latency (SOL) and wake after sleep onset (WASO) were significantly related in the lab nights; however, they shared only 16% of variance and the difference between the CSD and PSG values was significant. The correlations for SOL and WASO were 50% smaller and non-significant during the home nights. CSD and PSG TST and SE had only weak and non-significant correlations both in the laboratory and at home. Conclusion(s): The CSD was consistent with the clinical interview in 88% of the sample. Most patients with post-concussion insomnia found the CSD to be an acceptable tool for prospective sleep monitoring. The pattern of correlation with actigraphy was similar to the relationship between these measures in a previous insomnia disorder and good sleeper validation sample but the strength of correlations was weaker for SOL and WASO in the concussion clinical group (Maich, 2016). There was a significant discrepancy between the CSD and PSG indices due to patients' overestimation of wake time and under-estimation of sleep time. As in other clinical groups, the sleep diary should be treated as a tool that captures subjective sleep perception among individuals with post-concussion insomnia. Although it is a feasible measure for subjective sleep perception, it cannot be used to accurately measure sleep indices at a group level.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Tom""=>""Included"", ""s.fueggle""=>""Included""}",,actimetry;adult;clinical article;*concussion;DSM-5;female;human;human tissue;*insomnia;interview;male;monitoring;*night sleep;perception;sleep latency;sleep quality;sleep time;software;validation process;conference abstract;Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders,,,,The evaluation of the consensus sleep diary in patients with post-concussion insomnia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Eleven male collegiate basketball players participated in a 5- to7-week sleep extension period in which they increased their sleep by an average of 110.9 min, with the goal of increasing nocturnal sleep to a minimum of 10 hr per night. Measures of athletic performance were collected after each practice. Athletes completed an electronic psychomotor vigilance task twice daily during the course of the study. Results showed improvements in shooting accuracy and sprint times, as well as decreases in sleepiness scores and reaction times during the psychomotor vigilance task. By comparing the athletes' sleep journals and the actigraphy data, the authors found that athletes typically underestimated their sleep duration. This finding suggests that athletes may think they are achieving an adequate amount and quality of sleep, when in fact they require more nocturnal sleep to perform at optimal levels. This study suggests that increasing athletes' total nocturnal sleep time is a useful strategy for improving indices of performance as well as subjective measures of well-being.
