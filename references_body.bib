abstract = {Objectives: The Standards of Practice Committee of the American Sleep Disorders Association has supported the use of actigraphy in the assessment of sleep disorders. Pollak et al disagree. The objective of this paper is to identify and critically evaluate several theoretic and methodologic issues that are central to these divergent views regarding the valid use of actigraphy for sleep assessment. Design: Critical review, analysis, and comment. Setting: N/A Patients/Participants: N/A Interventions: N/A Measurements and Results: N/A. Conclusions: (1) Coefficients of the validity of actigraphy exceed those associated with common medical tests and the best psychological tests. (2) Reasons why actigraphy should be held to a substantially higher empirical standard than common medical tests and the best psychological tests have yet to be advanced. (3) Differences between actigraphy and polysomnography are not random and can be reduced. (3a) Sleep onset is a gradual rather than a discrete process. Actigraphy keys on an earlier phase of the sleep-onset process than does polysomnography, resulting in systematic rather than random differences. (3b) A sleep switch device can be used to substantially increase the accuracy of sleep-onset times. (3c) The residual unreliability of polysomnographic data explains a portion of the differences between actigraphy and polysomnography. Actigraphy cannot be expected to agree more completely with polysomnography than polysomnography does with itself. (4) Complete agreement between actigraphy and polysomnography has been presumed, but achieving such a limit is theoretically impossible. Some lower maximum agreement limit should be identified. (5) Conclusions that actigraphy is not an accurate sleep-wake indicator and that it is inappropriate to infer sleep from actigraphy data are not supported by the findings. Conclusions reached, including caveats, by the Standards of Practice Committee remain supported.},

abstract = {Cyclic alternating pattern CAP is the EEG marker of unstable sleep, a concept which is poorly appreciated among the metrics of sleep physiology. Besides, duration, depth and continuity, sleep restorative properties depend on the capacity of the brain to create periods of sustained stable sleep. This issue is not confined only to the EEG activities but reverberates upon the ongoing autonomic activity and behavioral functions, which are mutually entrained in a synchronized oscillation. CAP can be identified both in adult and children sleep and therefore represents a sensitive tool for the investigation of sleep disorders across the lifespan. The present review illustrates the story of CAP in the last 25 years, the standardized scoring criteria, the basic physiological properties and how the dimension of sleep instability has provided new insight into pathophysiolology and management of sleep disorders. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

While knowledge development about insomnia continues to require multi-trait, multi-method studies, self-report measures remain central in most study designs. The available stock of insomnia-related questionnaires has a substantial heterogeneity in their formats, foci, scopes, and other attributes. While there may be benefits from using specially tailored questionnaires in particular circumstances, in other cases the information quality of a study will be downgraded by poor choice of questionnaires. To assist clinicians and investigators in selecting questionnaires wisely, the present paper reviews questionnaire criteria and attribute priorities for clinical trials, theory tests, observational studies, and aging studies concerning insomnia. An extensive table of currently available questionnaires is provided, and some needs for future questionnaire development are also identified. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Aili2017,
abstract = {Study Objectives: The aim of the study was to investigate how many nights of measurement are needed for a reliable measure of sleep in a working population including adult women and men. Methods: In all, 54 individuals participated in the study. Sleep was assessed for 7 consecutive nights using actigraphy as an objective measure, and the Karolinska sleep diary for a subjective measure of quality. Using intra-class correlation and the Spearman-Brown formula, calculations of how many nights of measurements were required for a reliable measure were performed. Differences in reliability according to whether or not weekend measurements were included were investigated. Further, the correlation between objectively (actigraphy) measured sleep and subjectively measured sleep quality was studied over the different days of the week. Results/Conclusions: The results concerning actigraphy sleep measures suggest that data from at least 2 nights are to be recommended when assessing sleep percent and at least 5 nights when assessing sleep efficiency. For actigraphy-measured total sleep time, more than 7 nights are needed. At least 6 nights of measurements are required for a reliable measure of self-reported sleep. Fewer nights (days) are required if measurements include only week nights. Overall, there was a low correlation between the investigated actigraphy sleep parameters and subjective sleep quality, suggesting that the two methods of measurement capture different dimensions of sleep.},

	abstract = {Background: The importance of maternal sleep and its contribution to maternal and fetal health during pregnancy is increasingly being recognised. However, the ability to accurately recall sleep practices during pregnancy has been questioned. The aim of this study is to test the accuracy of recall of normal sleep practices in late pregnancy.
Methods: Thirty healthy women between 35 and 38 weeks of gestation underwent level III respiratory polysomnography (PSG) with infrared digital video recordings in their own homes. Data regarding sleep positions, number of times getting out of bed during the night and respiratory measures were collected. A sleep questionnaire was administered the morning after the recorded sleep. Continuous data were assessed using Spearman’s Rho and Bland-Altman. Cohen’s Kappa was used to assess recall in the categorical variables.
Results: Two-thirds of participants went to sleep on their left side. There was good agreement in sleep onset position between video and questionnaire data (Kappa 0.52), however the there was poor agreement on position on wakening (Kappa 0.24). The number of times getting out of bed during the night was accurately recalled (Kappa 0.65). Twenty five out of 30 participants snored as recorded by PSG. Questionnaire data was inaccurate for this measure. Bland-Altman plots demonstrated acceptable agreement between video and questionnaire data for estimated sleep duration, but not the time taken to fall asleep (sleep latency). One participant had mild obstructive sleep apnoea and another probable high upper airways resistance.
Conclusions: Sleep onset position, sleep duration and the number of times getting out of bed during the night were accurately recalled, but sleep latency and sleep position on waking were not. This study identifies the sleep variables that can be accurately obtained by questionnaire and those that cannot.},

People denoted as ‘‘morning types’’ (‘‘larks’’) like to rise early in the morning and go to bed early, while ‘‘evening types’’ (‘‘owls’’) prefer to sleep until later in the day and stay up until later at night. Various self-report instruments that measure morningness-eveningness have been developed. The aim of this study was to validate seven different self-report measures on morningness-eveningness using actigraphic data. One hundred and sixty-six students (mean age 21.4 years, range 19–30) were recruited from the University of Bergen and Bergen University College. The participants completed the self-report measures and wore an actigraph for seven days. The results showed that all self-report measures were in concordance with actigraphy-measured bed times, rise times, and the nadir for physical activity. In addition, some of the instruments were sensitive to differences between morning and evening types in their total sleep time on weekend nights or their stability in the activity curve across days as measured by actigraphy. Both the strengths and weaknesses of the present study are discussed, and proposals for future research are presented.},

	abstract = {Methods: Sleep diaries and actigraphy data were obtained from 223 adults with fibromyalgia and insomnia (age = 51.53 [standard deviation = 11.90] years; 93\% women) for 14 days. Sleep discrepancy was calculated by subtracting diary from actigraphy estimates of sleep onset latency (SOL-D), wake after sleep onset (WASO-D), and total sleep time (TST-D) for each night. Night-to-night variability in sleep discrepancy was calculated by taking the within-individual standard deviations over 14 days. Participants completed measures of mood, pain, fatigue, sleep/pain medications, nap duration, and caffeine consumption.
Results: Average sleep discrepancies across 14 days were small for all sleep parameters ({\textless} 10 minutes). There was no consistent positive or negative discrepancy. However, sleep discrepancy for any single night was large, with average absolute discrepancies greater than 30 minutes for all sleep parameters. Greater morning pain was associated with larger previous-night WASO-D, although diary and actigraphy estimates of WASO remained fairly concordant. Taking prescribed pain medications, primarily opioids, was associated with greater night-to-night variability in WASO-D and TST-D.
Conclusions: Unlike patients with primary insomnia, patients with comorbid fibromyalgia do not exhibit consistent negative sleep discrepancy; however, there are both substantial positive and negative discrepancies in all sleep parameters at the daily level. Future research is needed to investigate the clinical significance and implications of high night-to-night variability of sleep discrepancy, and the role of prescribed opioid medications in sleep perception.},

	abstract = {Background: Given the harmful effects of night shifts and rotating schedules on nurses’ sleep and work performance, shift nurses’ sleep patterns have been a research concern. Actigraphy involves acquisition of data using a movement sensor worn continuously on the nondominant wrist, typically for a week or more. Although actigraphy provides objective and accurate sleep data, sleep diaries have been a practical alternative. However, there is a lack of research on the agreement and consistency between the two methods of measuring sleep for shift work nurses. In addition, differences in sleep patterns by shift types among 8-hour fast-rotating shift work nurses has not yet been examined.
Objectives: To evaluate the agreement between the sleep diary and actigraphy methods for sleep assessment, and to compare sleep parameters of 8-hour fast-rotating shift work nurses according to shift type. Design: Descriptive and prospective study design. Settings: Two tertiary hospitals in Seoul, South Korea. Participants: A total of 94 shift work nurses who wore actigraphy along with completing a sleep diary.
Methods: Subjective and objective sleep parameters were recorded during a two-week period in a sleep diary and actigraphy, respectively. Bland-Altman plots and intraclass correlation coeﬃcients were used to analyze the agreement between the two methods. Sleep parameters according to shift type were compared using the Kruskal–Wallis and Mann–Whitney U tests.
Results: Good agreement was observed between the sleep diary and the actigraphy data for total sleep time (intraclass correlation coeﬃcients = 0.765 or 0.858) and variability in sleep time (intraclass correlation coeﬃcients = 0.838). When compared to the actigraphy data, diary-derived data were overestimated by 41–45 min for total sleep time and 0.4\% for variability in sleep time. There was a difference of 2–3 h of sleep quantity by shift type: 5.3–5.8 h for day shifts and 7.1–8.4 h for night shifts.
Conclusions: A sleep diary can function as an acceptable alternative to actigraphy for measuring shift work nurses’ sleep patterns, speciﬁcally total sleep time and variability in sleep time. Given the high variability in sleep among shift work nurses, both personal and organizational efforts are required. Nurses should monitor their sleep quantity and develop their own regular sleep schedules to ﬁt their work schedules. Hospitals should establish healthy schedules for nurses to guarantee suﬃcient sleep hours before work. Future research on shift work nurses’ sleep should examine ﬂuctuations in sleep duration.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To compare objective and subjective measurements of napping and to examine the relationship between evening napping and nocturnal sleep in older adults. DESIGN: For 12 days, participants wore actigraphs and completed sleep diaries. SETTING: Community. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred individuals who napped, aged 60 to 89 (including good and poor sleepers with typical age-related medical comorbidities).
MEASUREMENTS: Twelve days of sleep diary and actigraphy provided subjective and objective napping and sleep data.
RESULTS: Evening naps (within 2 hours of bedtime) were characteristic of the sample, with peak nap time occurring between 20:30 and 21:00 (average nap time occurred between 14:30 and 15:00). Two categories of nappers were identiﬁed: those who took daytime and evening naps and daytime-only. No participants napped during the evening only. Day-and-evening nappers signiﬁcantly underreported evening napping and demonstrated lower objectively measured sleep onset latencies (20.0 vs 26.5 minutes), less wake after sleep onset (51.4 vs 72.8 minutes), and higher sleep efﬁciencies (76.8 vs 82\%) than daytime-only nappers.
CONCLUSION: Day and evening napping was prevalent in this sample of community-dwelling good and poor sleepers but was not associated with impaired nocturnal sleep. Although the elimination or restriction of napping is a common element of cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia, these results suggest that a uniform recommendation to restrict or eliminate napping (particularly evening napping) may not meet the needs of all older individuals with insomnia.

	abstract = {Methods: Data analysis was based on secondary analysis of standard in-lab polysomnographic recordings in 20 elderly people with insomnia and 21 elderly good sleepers. Parameters indicating sleep fragmentation, such as number of awakenings, wake after sleep onset (WASO) and percentage of NREM1 were extracted from the polsysomnogram, as well as spectral power, microarousals and sleep spindle index. The correlation between these parameters during the ﬁrst sleep cycle and the amount of misperceived sleep was assessed in the insomnia group. Additionally, we made a model of the minimum duration that a sleep fragment at sleep onset should have in order to be perceived as sleep, and we ﬁtted this model to subjective SOLs of both subject groups.
Results: Misperception of SOL was associated with increased percentage of NREM1 and more WASO during sleep cycle 1. For insomnia subjects, the best ﬁt of modelled SOL with subjective SOL was found when assuming that sleep fragments shorter than 30 min at sleep onset were perceived as wake. The model indicated that healthy subjects are less sensitive to sleep interruptions and perceive fragments of 10 min or longer as sleep.
Conclusions: Our ﬁndings suggest that sleep onset misperception is related to sleep fragmentation at the beginning of the night. Moreover, we show that people with insomnia needed a longer duration of continuous sleep for the perception as such compared to controls. Further expanding the model could provide more detailed information about the underlying mechanisms of sleep misperception.},

We compared subjective and objective sleep-wake durations to characterize misperception. We introduce a new metric, sleep during subjective latency (SDSL), which captures latency misperception without defining objective sleep latency and allows correction for latency misperception when assessing total sleep time (TST) misperception.
Results: The stage content of SDSL is related to latency misperception, but in the opposite manner as our hypothesis: those with {\textgreater} 20 minutes of SDSL had less N1\%, more N3\%, and lower transition frequency. After adjusting for misperceived sleep during subjective sleep latency, TST misperception was greater in those with longer bouts of REM and N2 stages (OSA patients) as well as N3 (non-OSA patients), which also did not support our hypothesis.
Conclusions: Despite the advantages of SDSL as a phenotyping tool to overcome operational issues with quantifying misperception, our results argue against the hypothesis that light or fragmented sleep underlies misperception. Further investigation of sleep physiology utilizing alternative methods than that captured by conventional stages may yield additional mechanistic insights into misperception.},

Whether this perception can be expressed, in a standardized questionnaire as the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), has to our knowledge never been documented in CFS. Furthermore, correlations of subjective fatigue, PSQI, affective symptoms and objective parameters such as sleep efficiency are poorly described in the literature. \textit{Methods:} Using a cross-sectional paradigm, we studied subjective measures like PSQI, Fatigue Severity Scale scores and intensity of affective symptoms rated by the Hamilton Depression and Anxiety scales as well as objective sleep quality parameters measured by polysomnography of 28 ‘pure’ (no primary sleep and no psychiatric disorders) CFS patients compared to age- and gender-matched healthy controls. \textit{Results:} The PSQI showed significantly poorer subjective sleep quality in CFS patients than in healthy controls. In contrast, objective sleep quality parameters, like the Sleep Efficiency Index (SEI) or the amount of slow-wave sleep did not differ significantly. Subjective sleep quality showed a correlation trend with severity of fatigue and was not correlated with the intensity of affective symptoms in CFS. \textit{Conclusion:} Our findings indicate that a sleep quality misperception exists in CFS or that potential nocturnal neurophysiological disturbances involved in the nonrecovering sensation in CFS are not expressed by sleep variables such as the SEI or sleep stage distributions and proportions.},

abstract = {Despite the prevalence of sleep complaints among psychiatric patients, few questionnaires have been specifically designed to measure sleep quality in clinical populations. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is a self-rated questionnaire which assesses sleep quality and disturbances over a 1-month time interval. Nineteen individual items generate seven "component" scores: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medication, and daytime dysfunction. The sum of scores for these seven components yields one global score. Clinical and clinimetric properties of the PSQI were assessed over an 18-month period with "good" sleepers (healthy subjects, n = 52) and "poor" sleepers (depressed patients, n = 54; sleep-disorder patients, n = 62). Acceptable measures of internal homogeneity, consistency (test-retest reliability), and validity were obtained. A global PSQI score greater than 5 yielded a diagnostic sensitivity of 89.6% and specificity of 86.5% (kappa = 0.75, p less than 0.001) in distinguishing good and poor sleepers. The clinimetric and clinical properties of the PSQI suggest its utility both in psychiatric clinical practice and research activities.},

abstract = {Objective: The objective of this paper is to describe the updated methodological guidance for conducting a JBI scoping review, with a focus on new updates to the approach and development of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (the PRISMA-ScR). Introduction: Scoping reviews are an increasingly common approach to informing decision-making and research based on the identification and examination of the literature on a given topic or issue. Scoping reviews draw on evidence from any research methodology and may also include evidence from non-research sources, such as policy. In thismanner, scoping reviews provide a comprehensive overviewto address broader reviewquestions than traditionally more specific systematic reviews of effectiveness or qualitative evidence. The increasing popularity of scoping reviews has been accompanied by the development of a reporting guideline: The PRISMA-ScR. In 2014, the JBI Scoping Review Methodology Group developed guidance for scoping reviews that received minor updates in 2017 and was most recently updated in 2020. The updates reflect ongoing and substantial developments in approaches to scoping review conduct and reporting. As such, the JBI Scoping Review Methodology Group recognized the need to revise the guidance to align with the current state of knowledge and reporting standards in evidence synthesis. Methods: Between 2015 and 2020, the JBI Scoping Review Methodology Group expanded its membership, extensively reviewed the literature, engaged via annual face-to-face meetings, regular teleconferences, and email correspondence, sought advice from methodological experts, facilitated workshops, and presented at scientific onferences. This process led to updated guidance for scoping reviews published in the JBI Manual for Evidence Synthesis. The updated chapter was endorsed by JBI's International Scientific Committee in 2020. Results: The updated JBI guidance for scoping reviews includes additional guidance on several methodological issues, such as when a scoping review is (or is not) appropriate, and how to extract, analyze, and present results, and provides clarification for implications for practice and research. Furthermore, it is aligned with the PRISMA-ScR to ensure consistent reporting. Conclusions: The latest JBI guidance for scoping reviews provides up-to-date guidance that can be used by authors when conducting a scoping review. Furthermore, it aligns with the PRISMA-ScR, which can be used to report the conduct of a scoping review. A series of ongoing and future methodological projects identified by the JBI Scoping Review Methodology Group to further refine the methodology are planned.},

abstract = {Insomnia is a highly prevalent health problem worldwide. Primary insomnia (PI), i.e., insomnia not due to another disorder or substance use, represents a model to elucidate the pathophysiology of sleep. However, prior research in patients with PI has failed to demonstrate consistent abnormalities in the state-of-the-art assessment of sleep (polysomnography). The aim of this meta-analysis was to clarify whether there are identifiable polysomnographic sleep changes that correspond to the subjective complaints of patients with PI. Medline and PsycInfo databases were searched from 1994 to 2012. Effects were calculated as standardized mean differences. Studies were pooled with the random-effects metaanalytic model. Twenty-three studies met inclusion criteria. In total, 582 patients with PI and 485 good sleeper controls (GSC) were evaluated. The results showed that patients with PI present a disruption of sleep continuity and a significant reduction of slow wave sleep (SWS) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep compared to GSC. The observed changes in sleep architecture, i.e., reductions in SWS and REM sleep, hitherto did not count among the typical polysomnographic findings in patients with PI. An advanced knowledge of the polysomnographic changes in PI may add to foster the understanding of the pathophysiology of sleep and its bi-directional relationships with somatic and mental disorders.},

Data were collected and compared from both objective and subjective sleep measures.

However, Ss' sleep time perceptions were widely distributed across a broad continuum, which ranged between gross underestimates and remarkable overestimates of actual sleep times. Results also showed that subgroups, formed on the basis of presenting complaints and diagnostic criteria, differed in regard to the magnitude and direction of their sleep distortions. Moreover, these differences appeared consistent with the types of objective sleep disturbances these subgroups commonly experience. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)},

@article{Means2003,
abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine the distribution, consistency, and correlates of sleep time perceptions in primary insomnia sufferers and normal sleepers across settings (laboratory and home)., METHODS: Fifty-two middle-aged and older insomnia sufferers and 49 matched normal sleepers underwent multiple nights of laboratory and home polysomnography (PSG) and provided concurrent subjective estimates of their sleep. Descriptive statistics, cluster analyses, and inferential tests were used to examine the nature of sleep time perceptions, identify subgroups with distinctive patterns such as perceptions, and explore factors that may contribute to these subgroups' distinctive sleep perceptions., RESULTS: Consistent with previous studies, the insomnia sufferers, as a group, showed a greater tendency to underestimate the time they slept than did the normal sleepers, but the accuracy of sleep time perceptions varied widely within each sample. Correlational analyses showed that study participants in each sample showed a moderate level of consistency in how accurately they estimated sleep time across nights. Subsequent cluster analyses conducted to identify subgroups with distinctive patterns of sleep time perceptions yielded four subgroups within the insomnia sample and three subgroups within the normal sleeper sample. Although the sleep setting significantly affected sleep perceptions for one insomnia subgroup, both laboratory and home objective-subjective sleep comparisons provided similar impressions regarding the relative accuracy of each subgroup's nocturnal sleep/wake perceptions. Finally, varying patterns of subgroup differences were noted across several common psychometric measures., CONCLUSIONS: The underestimation of sleep time is not a generic characteristic that separates all insomnia sufferers from normal sleepers. Sleep setting, personality traits, and perhaps constitutional factors appear to influence perceptions of sleep and wake time duration.},

@article{Perlis1997,
abstract = {A number of paradoxes are apparent in the assessment and treatment of psychophysiological insomnia and sleep state misperception. Three of these paradoxes exist as discrepancies between polysomnographic (PSG) measures and the subjective impressions regarding sleep quality and quantity. The remaining incongruity exists largely within the objective domain, In the case of subjective-objective discrepancies, patients with insomnia: (1) frequently identify themselves as having been awake when awakened from PSG defined sleep; (2) tend to overestimate sleep latency and underestimate total sleep time as compared with PSG measures; (3) appear to derive more benefit from pharmacotherapy that can be explained by objective gains. The remaining paradox pertains to the observation that hypnotic medications, by and large, do not normalize sleep architecture or produce a more 'sleep-like' EEG. In this paper, we review possible explanations for these various paradoxes, introduce a new perspective and suggest possible research avenues. The model introduced is based on the observation that beta and/or gamma activity (which have been found to be associated with cognitive processes) is enhanced in insomnia at or around sleep onset. We propose that this kind of high frequency EEG activity may interfere with the normal establishment of sleep onset-related mesograde amnesia. As a result, the patient with insomnia maintains a level of information and/or memory processing that blurs the phenomenological distinction between sleep and wakefulness and influences retrospective judgments about sleep initiation and duration.},

@article{Cappuccio2010,
abstract = {Background: Increasing evidence suggests an association between both short and long duration of habitual sleep with adverse health outcomes. Objectives: To assess whether the population longitudinal evidence supports the presence of a relationship between duration of sleep and allcause mortality, to investigate both short and long sleep duration and to obtain an estimate of the risk. Methods: We performed a systematic search of publications using MEDLINE (1966-2009), EMBASE (from 1980), the Cochrane Library, and manual searches without language restrictions. We included studies if they were prospective, had follow-up >3 years, had duration of sleep at baseline, and all-cause mortality prospectively. We extracted relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) and pooled them using a random effect model. We carried out sensitivity analyses and assessed heterogeneity and publication bias. Results: Overall, the 16 studies analyzed provided 27 independent cohort samples. They included 1,382,999 male and female participants (followup range 4 to 25 years), and 112,566 deaths. Sleep duration was assessed by questionnaire and outcome through death certification. In the pooled analysis, short duration of sleep was associated with a greater risk of death (RR: 1.12; 95% CI 1.06 to 1.18; P < 0. 01) with no evidence of publication bias (P = 0.74) but heterogeneity between studies (P = 0.02). Long duration of sleep was also associated with a greater risk of death (1.30; [1.22 to 1.38]; P < 0.0001) with no evidence of publication bias (P = 0.18) but significant heterogeneity between studies (P < 0.0001). Conclusion: Both short and long duration of sleep are significant predictors of death in prospective population studies.},

abstract = {Objective/Background: Sleep plays a central role in maintaining health and cognition. In most epidemiologic studies, sleep is evaluated by self-report questionnaires but several reports suggest that these evaluations might be less accurate than objective measures such as polysomnography or actigraphy. Determinants of the discrepancy between objective and subjective measures remain to be investigated. The aim of this pilot-study was to examine the role of mood states in determining the discrepancy observed between objective and subjective measures of sleep duration in older adults. Patients/Methods: Objective sleep quantity and quality were recorded by actigraphy in a sample of 45 elderly subjects over at least three consecutive nights. Subjective sleep duration and supplementary data, such as mood status and memory, were evaluated using ecological momentary assessment (EMA). Results: A significant discrepancy was observed between EMA and actigraphic measures of sleep duration (p < 0.001). The magnitude of this difference was explained by the patient's mood status (p = 0.020). No association was found between the magnitude of this discrepancy and age, sex, sleep quality or memory performance. Conclusion: The discrepancy classically observed between objective and subjective measures of sleep duration can be explained by mood status at the time of awakening. These results have potential implications for epidemiologic and clinical studies examining sleep as a risk factor for morbidity or mortality.},

abstract = {Purpose: To investigate the agreement in sleep pattern recording by self-reported sleep questionnaires and actigraphy in adults. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study. Men and women who metÂ inclusion criteria were recruited for this study. The inclusion criteria were apparently healthy Omani nationalsÂ ages 19 to 50 years. Sleep questionnaires were randomly distributed in Muscat either directly or via electronic and paper announcements. Data were collected from the participants using the self-reported questionnaires with four piloted questions for sleep pattern identification and through the actigraphy wristband given to subjects to wear for a week. Cohen's kappa test was performed for agreement analysis. Results: A total of 964 Omani subjects between ages 18 and 59 years of both genders were recruited and completed the questionnaires successfully. Out of these, only 321 subjects wore the actigraphy wristband for 1 week (response rate = 33%). Agreement analysis reported a mild level of agreement for the monophasic (41%), moderate level for biphasic (59%), and good level for polyphasic (70%) sleep patterns. The overall agreement level of sleep patterns between the two methods was 57%. There is a low specificity of self-reported assessment in reporting sleep pattern. Conclusion: The average agreement level of subjective versus objective assessments of sleep patterns was moderate at 57% and self-reported sleep pattern is not specific. The study recommends the use of actigraphy along with sleep questionnaires for accurate assessment of sleep patterns in cohort studies.},

abstract = {Discrepancy between objective and subjective sleep parameters is a frequent symptom in persons suffering from insomnia. Since it has an impairing effect on daytime well-being and neglects possible positive objective improvements, it would be useful if it was treated. Apart from hypnotics, cognitive behavior therapy (CBT-I) is the therapy of choice for chronic forms of insomnia. However, there is limited information about whether CBT-I can also improve subjective-objective sleep discrepancy. We investigated a large sample of patients showing chronic forms of insomnia regarding their subjective-objective sleep discrepancy pre and post CBT-I. Objective sleep data were obtained from 3 nights (2 baseline nights and 1 night after therapy) using polysomnography in our sleep laboratory. All 92 patients participated in a 14-day inpatient program with CBT-I including psychoeducation about subjective-objective sleep discrepancy. Repeated measures analyses showed an improvement in subjective-objective sleep discrepancy parameters after CBT-I. Those parameters were also correlated with perceived quality of sleep. We conclude that CBT-I is a useful tool to improve subjective-objective sleep discrepancy in patients showing chronic forms of insomnia.},

Despite being recognized for a long time by the international community, it is still unclear whether this entity really exists, which are its features and boundaries. Much of the debate is fuelled by the lack of a consensus on its precise definition. To help filling some of the existing gaps, a systematic review of the literature was conducted, through which 19 different quantitative definitions were obtained. These definitions were then applied to two distinct datasets. The first consisted of 200 chronic primary insomnia patients, diagnosed according to the DSM-IV-TR criteria. The second consisted of 200 age- and sex-matched healthy persons without insomnia. For each dataset, available data from the objective sleep parameters and their subjective estimation were imported and analysed in MATLAB. Depending on the definition used, the prevalence of paradoxical insomnia ranged from 8 to 66%, while agreement between different definitions ranged from −0.19 to 0.9 (using Cohen's kappa coefficient). Based on the results garnered, necessary features for a quantitative definition of paradoxical insomnia were identified. Several open questions remain, such as whether there is a minimum number of hours a patient should sleep to fulfill the criteria for a diagnosis of paradoxical insomnia, and whether sleep latency can be used in the definition along with total sleep time. We conclude by advocating continued study of paradoxical insomnia and sleep state misperception and by providing specific directions for future research. Statement of significance: The current understanding of paradoxical insomnia and, more broadly, of sleep state misperception, is greatly hampered by the lack of agreement on a quantitative and evidence-base measure of the discrepancy between subjective and objective sleep evaluation. The current study provides a critical analysis about the strength and the limitations of the available definitions, using both a data-driven and a theory-driven approach. The overarching goal is to motivate a rigorous discussion involving the main experts of the field, to build a consensus, and develop an evidence-based measure of sleep state misperception and/or of paradoxical insomnia.},

@article{Arksey2005,
abstract = {This paper focuses on scoping studies, an approach to reviewing the literature which to date has received little attention in the research methods literature. We distinguish between different types of scoping studies and indicate where these stand in relation to full systematic reviews. We outline a framework for conducting a scoping study based on our recent experiences of reviewing the literature on services for carers for people with mental health problems. Where appropriate, our approach to scoping the field is contrasted with the procedures followed in systematic reviews. We emphasize how including a consultation exercise in this sort of study may enhance the results, making them more useful to policy makers, practitioners and service users. Finally, we consider the advantages and limitations of the approach and suggest that a wider debate is called for about the role of the scoping study in relation to other types of literature reviews. {\textcopyright} 2005 Taylor & Francis Group Ltd.},

@article{Rezaie2018,
abstract = {Paradoxical insomnia is characterized by discrepancy between subjective and objective assessments of sleep and is challenging to diagnosis and treat. Typically, polysomnographic (PSG) findings show significantly longer total sleep time than patients' report of sleep, and the difference between subjective and PSG sleep is greater than that seen in other insomnia subtypes. Subjective–objective sleep discrepancy may also present in different clinical pictures, as marked discrepancies between patients' perception of sleep and objective findings are common in a variety of medical, sleep and psychiatric disorders. However, there is a paucity of literature about the etiology and treatment of sleep discrepancy and paradoxical insomnia. Therefore, the underlying neurophysiological mechanisms of sleep discrepancy and paradoxical insomnia should be further investigated. Additionally, well-controlled clinical trials are needed to establish an evidence based intervention for treatment.},
