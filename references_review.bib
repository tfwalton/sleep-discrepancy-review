	abstract = {Insomnia is prevalent, causing severe distress and impairment. This review focuses on illuminating the puzzling finding that many insomnia patients misperceive their sleep. They overestimate their sleep onset latency (SOL) and underestimate their total sleep time (TST), relative to objective measures. This tendency is ubiquitous (although not universal). Resolving this puzzle has clinical, theoretical, and public health importance. There are implications for assessment, definition, and treatment. Moreover, solving the puzzle creates an opportunity for "real world" applications of theories from clinical, perceptual, and social psychology as well as neuroscience. Herein we evaluate thirteen possible resolutions to the puzzle. Specifically, we consider the possible contribution, to misperception, of: (1) features inherent to the context of sleep (e.g., darkness); (2) the definition of sleep onset which may lack sensitivity for insomnia patients; (3) insomnia being an exaggerated sleep complaint; (4) psychological distress causing magnification; (5) a deficit in time estimation ability; (6) sleep being misperceived as wake; (7) worry and selective attention toward sleep-related threats; (8) a memory bias influenced by current symptoms and emotions, a confirmation bias/belief bias or a recall bias linked to the intensity/ recency of symptoms; (9) heightened physiological arousal; (10) elevated cortical arousal; (11) the presence of brief awakenings; (12) a fault in neuronal circuitry; and (13) there being two insomnia subtypes (one with and one without misperception). The best supported resolutions were misperception of sleep as wake, worry, and brief awakenings. A deficit in time estimation ability was not supported. We conclude by proposing several integrative solutions.},

	abstract = {Twenty healthy men and women had their sleep recorded objectively, using polysomnography on 3 nonconsecutive nights. Following each night, the subjects assessed their sleep onset latency and number of awakenings, subjectively. Self-ratings were compared with objective measures of sleep onset latency (SOL), calculated as the time from lights-out to the ﬁrst continuous minute of stage 2 sleep, and the number of awakenings which lasted 1 minute or longer on the polysomnograms. Apart from the ﬁrst night, the subjects overestimated the time that it took them to fall asleep, despite sleep onset being scored as the latency to stage 2, rather than stage 1 sleep. On all 3 nights, the subjects underestimated the number of awakenings when compared to objective criteria. Although the subjects were consistent in their errors of estimation of their sleep compared to polysomnographic assessments over the three nights, the between-individual variation was large, so that objective and subjective ratings of SOL and awakenings were not correlated. The young men and women in our study, who were free of medication or sleep complaints, perceived their sleep inaccurately when compared to objective polysomnographic recordings. © 1999 Elsevier Science Inc.},

	abstract = {Ten insomniacs with age- and sex-matched controls had studies of baseline sleep, relation of polygraphically defined sleep to retrospective reports, and arousal thresholds to electronic tones or to a recording of a voice calling out the subject’s name. The two groups differed in IO out of I3 questions about habitual sleep and daytime feelings. In contrast, polygraphic measures of baseline sleep indicated only that insomniacs tended to have slightly less total sleep and had a small but significant increase in early morning awakening time. Unlike the descriptions of habitual sleep, the subjects’ retrospective reports of the previous night’s sleep differed significantly only for the variable of total sleep time, and there were virtually no differences in the description of their status at a given moment. Auditory arousal thresholds were similar in the two groups, and both went back to sleep and stayed asleep with equal facility. These findings suggest that subjectively poor sleep is not necessarily “light” sleep. For both groups, arousal thresholds differed across the sleep stages, and thresholds to hearing the subject’s name were lower than those in response to electronic tones. Although insomniacs had as much polygraphically defined sleep as controls between the forced awakenings of the arousal threshold studies, they perceived their sleep to be only approximately half as long. Insomniacs described themselves as having been awake more frequently than controls in 8 out of IO forced awakening situations. In one case, insomniacs also overestimated the time between awakenings. In both groups, there was little relationship between reported habitual aspects of sleep and baseline polygraphically defined sleep variables. On questionnaires the following mornings, however, in both groups there was a positive correlation of subjective quality of sleep on the baseline nights with percentage of rapid eye movement sleep, and a negative correlation to various aspects of slow-wave sleep.},

	abstract = {People with Insomnia Disorder tend to underestimate their sleep compared with polysomnography or actigraphy, a phenomenon known as paradoxical insomnia or sleep‐state misperception. Previous studies suggested that night‐to‐night variability could be an important feature differentiating subtypes of misperception. This study aimed for a data‐driven definition of misperception subtypes revealed by multiple sleep features including night‐to‐night variability. We assessed features describing the mean and dispersion of misperception and objective and subjective sleep duration from 7‐night diary and actigraphy recordings of 181 people with Insomnia Disorder and 55 people without sleep complaints. A minimally collinear subset of features was submitted to latent class analysis for data‐driven subtyping. Analysis revealed three subtypes, best discriminated by three of five selected features: an individual’s shortest reported subjective sleep duration; and the mean and standard deviation of misperception. These features were on average 5.4, −0.0 and 0.5 hr in one subtype accommodating the majority of good sleepers; 4.1, −1.4 and 1.0 hr in a second subtype representing the majority of people with Insomnia Disorder; and 1.7, −2.2 and 1.5 hr in a third subtype representing a quarter of people with Insomnia Disorder and hardly any good sleepers. Subtypes did not differ on an individual’s objective sleep duration mean (6.9, 7.2 and 6.9 hr) and standard deviation (0.8, 0.8 and 0.9 hr). Data‐driven analysis of naturalistic sleep revealed three subtypes that markedly differed in misperception features. Future studies may include misperception subtype to investigate whether it contributes to the unexplained considerable individual variability in treatment response.},

	abstract = {Methods:  Two hundred ninety-three participants were monitored at home for up to six nights with scEEG, actigraphy, and sleep diaries. Total sleep time (TST), sleep efficiency (SE), sleep onset latency (SOL), and wake after sleep onset (WASO) were calculated using each of these methods. In 109 of the 293 participants, the ratio of cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of phosphorylated tau (p-tau) and amyloid-β-42 (Aβ42) was used as a biomarker for AD pathology.
Results:  Agreement was highest for TST across instruments, especially in cognitively normal older adults. Overall, scEEG and actigraphy appeared to have greater agreement for multiple sleep parameters than for scEEG and diary or actigraphy and diary. Levels of agreement between scEEG and actigraphy overall decreased in mildly impaired participants and those with biomarker evidence of AD pathology, especially for measurements of TST.
Conclusions:  Caution should be exercised when comparing scEEG and actigraphy in individuals with mild cognitive impairment or with AD pathology. Sleep diaries may capture different aspects of sleep compared to scEEG and actigraphy. Additional studies comparing different methods of measuring sleep-wake activity in older adults are necessary to allow for comparison between studies using different methods.},

	abstract = {Objectives:  To extend and validate a previously suggested model of the influence of uninterrupted sleep bouts on sleep onset misperception in a large independent data set.
Methods:  Polysomnograms and sleep diaries of 139 insomnia patients and 92 controls were included. We modeled subjective sleep onset as the start of the first uninterrupted sleep fragment longer than Ls minutes, where parameter Ls reflects the minimum length of a sleep fragment required to be perceived as sleep. We compared the so-defined sleep onset latency (SOL) for various values of Ls. Model parameters were compared between groups, and across insomnia subgroups with respect to sleep onset misperception, medication use, age, and sex. Next, we extended the model to incorporate the length of wake fragments. Model performance was assessed by calculating root mean square errors (RMSEs) of the difference between estimated and perceived SOL.
Results:  Participants with insomnia needed a median of 34 minutes of undisturbed sleep to perceive sleep onset, while healthy controls needed 22 minutes (Mann–Whitney U = 4426, p {\textless} 0.001). Similar statistically significant differences were found between sleep onset misperceivers and non-misperceivers (median 40 vs. 20 minutes, Mann–Whitney U = 984.5, p {\textless} 0.001). Model outcomes were similar across other subgroups. Extended models including wake bout lengths resulted in only marginal improvements of model outcome.
Conclusions:  Patients with insomnia, particularly sleep misperceivers, need larger continuous sleep bouts to perceive sleep onset. The modeling approach yields a parameter for which we coin the term Sleep Fragment Perception Index, providing a useful measure to further characterize sleep state misperception.},

The present study aimed to assess the effect of cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia on subjective and objective sleep discrepancy of total sleep time, sleep-onset latency and wake after sleep onset. The total sleep time discrepancy was also assessed across the entire therapy. The second aim was to examine the treatment outcome of two insomnia groups differing in sleep perception. Thirty-six adults with insomnia (mean age = 46.7 years, SD = 13.9; 22 females) were enrolled in the final analyses. Patients underwent a 6-week group cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia programme. Sleep diary and actigraphy measurements were obtained during the therapy. Patients who underestimated total sleep time (n = 16; underestimating group) were compared with patients who accurately perceived or overestimated total sleep time (n = 20; accurate/overestimating group). After cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia, a significant decrease of total sleep time and sleep-onset latency discrepancy was observed without a change in wake after sleep onset discrepancy in the total sample. Only the underestimating group reported decreased sleep-onset latency discrepancy after the treatment, whereas total sleep time discrepancy significantly changed in both groups. The underestimating group showed a significant decrease of total sleep time discrepancy from Week 1 to Week 2 when the sleep restriction was implemented, whereas the accurate/ overestimating group showed the first significant change at Week 4.

	abstract = {Good sleep quality is important to cognition, physical health, mental well-being, and creativity—factors critical to academic and professional success. But, undergraduate students often report engaging in short, irregular, and poor-quality sleep. Anecdotal and questionnaire data suggest that poor sleep habits might be prevalent in students who are in studio- or project-based majors that implicitly encourage consecutive nights of disrupted sleep to complete projects. We investigated sleep quantity and quality using both objective measures (wristband actigraphy monitoring) and subjective measures (sleep diary) in 28 interior design undergraduate students for a 7-day period. Our primary aim was to measure sleep quantity (total sleep time) and quality (e.g., nighttime awakenings) and to compare whether undergraduate interior design students’ objective measures of sleep (actigraphy) differed from their subjective measures (sleep diary). The secondary aim was to investigate detrimental outcomes of poor sleep habits on laboratory-based measures of cognitive function (symmetry span, prospective memory, Raven’s progressive matrices, remote associates task) that were administered pre- and poststudy. We found that the interior design students in our study overestimated their total sleep time by 36 minutes, that 79\% of students slept for fewer than 7 hours at least three nights per week, and that many students cycled between nights of restricted/short sleep and recovery/long sleep. Importantly, students who maintained short sleep durations, highly variable night-to-night sleep durations, or had fragmented sleep (i.e., waking after sleep onset) demonstrated pre- to poststudy declines on the laboratory measure of creativity (remote associates task). These ﬁndings suggest the need for further investigations, which may lead to a broader discussion of studio culture and the role of the “all-nighter,” both in professional practice and in design education.},

Results:  Actigraphy and PSG produced similar estimates of sleep duration and efficiency.

	abstract = {Individuals with insomnia present unique patterns of electroencephalographic (EEG) asymmetry between homologous regions of each brain hemisphere, yet few studies have assessed asymmetry within the same hemisphere. Increase in intrahemispheric asymmetry during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep in good sleepers (GS) and disruption of REM sleep in insomnia suﬀerers (INS) both point out that this activity may be involved in the pathology of insomnia. The objective of the present exploratory study was to evaluate and quantify patterns of fronto-central, fronto-parietal, fronto-occipital, centro-parietal, centro-occipital and parieto-occipital intrahemispheric asymmetry in GS and INS, and to assess their association with sleep-wake misperception, daytime anxiety and depressive symptoms, as well as insomnia severity. This paper provides secondary analysis of standard EEG recorded in 43 INS and 19 GS for three nights in a sleep laboratory. Asymmetry measures were based on EEG power spectral analysis within 0.3–60 Hz computed between pairs of regions at frontal, central, parietal and occipital derivations. Repeated-measures ANOVAs were performed to assess group diﬀerences. Exploratory correlations were then performed on asymmetry and sleep-wake misperception, as well as self-reported daytime anxiety and depressive symptoms, and insomnia severity. INS presented increased delta and theta F3/P3 asymmetry during REM sleep compared with GS, positively associated with depressive and insomnia complaints. INS also exhibited decreased centro-occipital (C3/O1, C4/O2) and parieto-occipital (P3–O1, P4/O2) theta asymmetry during REM. These ﬁndings suggest that INS present speciﬁc patterns of intrahemispheric asymmetry, partially related to their clinical symptoms. Future studies may investigate the extent to which asymmetry is related to sleep-wake misperception or memory impairments.},

	abstract = {Purpose To investigate the agreement in sleep pattern recording by self-reported sleep questionnaires and actigraphy in adults.
Methods This is a cross-sectional study. Men and women who met inclusion criteria were recruited for this study. The inclusion criteria were apparently healthy Omani nationals ages 19 to 50 years. Sleep questionnaires were randomly distributed in Muscat either directly or via electronic and paper announcements. Data were collected from the participants using the self-reported questionnaires with four piloted questions for sleep pattern identification and through the actigraphy wristband given to subjects to wear for a week. Cohen’s kappa test was performed for agreement analysis.
Results A total of 964 Omani subjects between ages 18 and 59 years of both genders were recruited and completed the questionnaires successfully. Out of these, only 321 subjects wore the actigraphy wristband for 1 week (response rate = 33\%). Agreement analysis reported a mild level of agreement for the monophasic (41\%), moderate level for biphasic (59\%), and good level for polyphasic (70\%) sleep patterns. The overall agreement level of sleep patterns between the two methods was 57\%. There is a low specificity of self-reported assessment in reporting sleep pattern.
Conclusion The average agreement level of subjective versus objective assessments of sleep patterns was moderate at 57\% and self-reported sleep pattern is not specific. The study recommends the use of actigraphy along with sleep questionnaires for accurate assessment of sleep patterns in cohort studies.},

	abstract = {Studies of the correlation of subjective and objective sleep measures in depressed patients have produced mixed results so far. Further, they were carried out in sleep laboratories and tended to obtain one-off assessments, thus not taking into account the effect of treatment. We investigated forty (40) patients over the course of 8-week treatment of depression with either paroxetine or nefazodone. We used home polysomnography at baseline, nights 3 and 10, and week 8 of treatment, with extensive assessments of subjective sleep, the morning after each sleep recording. The patients were able to judge accurately their total sleep time and sleep onset latency, both before and during treatment. However, they were inaccurate in estimating the number of times they woke up during the night. Sleep satisfaction correlated negatively with Stage 1 sleep at baseline. Sleep quality was represented by a combination of subjective parameters measuring the ease of initiation and maintenance of sleep, and it appeared to derive from slow wave sleep and sleep continuity as seen in polysomnography. The partial discrepancy between subjective and objective measures suggests that a cognitive element is combined with the biological element to produce the sleep problems reported by depressed patients.},

	doi = {10.2147/NSS.S48970},
	abstract = {Background: While actigraphy has been deemed ideal for the longitudinal assessment of total sleep time (TST) by select groups, endorsement has not been universal and reimbursement is lacking, preventing its widespread use in clinical practice. This study compares longitudinal TST data obtained by actigraphy and logs preceding a clinical evaluation, and secondarily ascertains whether longitudinal TST impacts clinicians’ decisions to proceed with further sleep testing.
Methods: This was a retrospective, consecutive chart review spanning about 4 months in an academic sleep center. Eighty-four patients wore actigraphs in anticipation of clinical evaluations. Concomitant completion of sleep logs is routinely requested in this setting. Longitudinal TST data available in complete form was reviewed in a blinded fashion among a subset of these patients. A review of text from clinical notes of an expanded cohort with complete actigraphy data (regardless of the degree of completion of logs) enabled determination of the frequency and rationale for cancellation of prescheduled sleep testing.
Results: Of 84 actigraphy recordings, 90\% produced complete data, and 30\% produced fully completed logs. Among the subset with both available in complete form, significant mean TST differences were observed on weekends (7.06 ± 2.18 hours versus 8.30 ± 1.93 hours, P = 0.009), but not on weekdays (7.38 ± 1.97 hours versus 7.72 ± 1.62 hours, P = 0.450) for actigraphy and logs, respectively. Further analyses revealed poor agreement between the two measures, with predominantly increased TST estimation with logs. Among those with complete actigraphy data (±logs), testing was cancelled in 11 (15\%), eight of whom (73\%) presented with hypersomnia and three of whom (27\%) presented with insomnia. Determination of insufficient sleep time was cited as the primary reason for cancellation (64\%).
Conclusion: Actigraphy and sleep logs provided discrepant mean TST data on weekends only, and the latter predominantly estimated increased TST. Actigraphy was completed more reliably than logs. Longitudinal TST information influenced clinicians’ decisions to proceed with further testing, particularly among patients presenting with hypersomnia.},

	abstract = {Objective/Background: Sleep plays a central role in maintaining health and cognition. In most epidemiologic studies, sleep is evaluated by self-report questionnaires but several reports suggest that these evaluations might be less accurate than objective measures such as polysomnography or actigraphy. Determinants of the discrepancy between objective and subjective measures remain to be investigated. The aim of this pilot-study was to examine the role of mood states in determining the discrepancy observed between objective and subjective measures of sleep duration in older adults. Patients/Methods: Objective sleep quantity and quality were recorded by actigraphy in a sample of 45 elderly subjects over at least three consecutive nights. Subjective sleep duration and supplementary data, such as mood status and memory, were evaluated using ecological momentary assessment (EMA).
Results: A signiﬁcant discrepancy was observed between EMA and actigraphic measures of sleep duration (p {\textless} 0.001). The magnitude of this difference was explained by the patient’s mood status (p = 0.020). No association was found between the magnitude of this discrepancy and age, sex, sleep quality or memory performance.
Conclusion: The discrepancy classically observed between objective and subjective measures of sleep duration can be explained by mood status at the time of awakening. These results have potential implications for epidemiologic and clinical studies examining sleep as a risk factor for morbidity or mortality.},

	abstract = {The diagnosis and management of insomnia relies primarily on clinical history. However, patient self-report of sleep–wake times may not agree with objective measurements. We hypothesized that those with shallow or fragmented sleep would under-report sleep quantity, and that this might account for some of the mismatch. We compared objective and subjective sleep–wake times for 277 patients who underwent diagnostic polysomnography. The group included those with insomnia symptoms (n = 92), obstructive sleep apnea (n = 66) or both (n = 119). Mismatch of wake duration was context dependent: all three groups overestimated sleep latency but underestimated wakefulness after sleep onset. The insomnia group underestimated total sleep time by a median of 81 min. However, contrary to our hypothesis, measures of fragmentation (N1, arousal index, sleep efﬁciency, etc.) did not correlate with the subjective sleep duration estimates. To unmask a potential relationship between sleep architecture and subjective duration, we tested three hypotheses: N1 is perceived as wake; sleep bouts under 10 min are perceived as wake; or N1 and N2 are perceived in a weighted fashion. None of these hypotheses exposed a match between subjective and objective sleep duration. We show only modest performance of a Naïve Bayes Classiﬁer algorithm for predicting mismatch using clinical and polysomnographic variables. Subjective–objective mismatch is common in patients reporting insomnia symptoms. We conclude that mismatch was not attributable to commonly measured polysomnographic measures of fragmentation. Further insight is needed into the complex relationships between subjective perception of sleep and conventional, objective measurements.},

Four measurements were used to assess TST: Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, a newly developed habitual Extended Sleep Survey, a newly developed daily Emergency Services Sleep Diary (ESSD), and actigraphy. The Extended Sleep Survey and ESSD were constructed to address the specific job-related characteristics of fire and emergency services that other measurements cannot achieve (eg, multiple sleep episode in a single night).
Results: The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index TST is least accurate compared to actigraphy. The Extended Sleep Survey TST shows improvement over Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index TST, but was statistically different from actigraphy TST. No difference in mean TST was found between ESSD TST and actigraphy TST. Furthermore, ESSD TST and actigraphy TST correlated strongly together.
Conclusions: Without modification, traditional self-reported measures may not be appropriate in the fire and emergency service occupation. This study suggests that the ESSD may serve as a useful alternative to actigraphy to measure TST.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Sleep is often quantiﬁed using self-report or actigraphy. Self-report is practical and less technically challenging, but prone to bias. We sought to determine whether these methods have comparable sensitivity to measure longitudinal changes in adolescent bedtimes. Methods: We measured one week of free-living sleep with wrist actigraphy and usual bedtime on school nights and non-school nights with self-report questionnaire in 144 students at 15 y and 17 y. Results: Self-reported and actigraphy-measured bedtimes were correlated with one another at 15 y and 17 y (p {\textless} .001), but reported bedtime was consistently earlier ({\textgreater}30 minutes, p {\textless} .001) and with wide inter-method conﬁdence intervals ({\textgreater} ±106 minutes). Mean inter-method discrepancy did not differ on school nights at 15 y and 17 y but was greater at 17 y on non-school nights (p = .002). Inter-method discrepancy at 15 y was not correlated to that at 17 y. Mean change in self-reported school night bedtime from 15 y to 17 y did not differ from that by actigraphy, but selfreported bedtime changed less on non-school nights (p = .002). Two-year changes in self-reported bedtime did not correlate with changes measured by actigraphy. Conclusions: Although methods were correlated, consistently earlier self-reported bedtime suggests report-bias. More varied non-school night bedtimes challenge the accuracy of self-report and actigraphy, reducing sensitivity to change. On school nights, the methods did not differ in group-level sensitivity to changes in bedtime. However, lack of correlation between bedtime changes by each method suggests sensitivity to individual-level change was different. Methodological differences in sensitivity to individual- and group-level change should be considered in longitudinal studies of adolescent sleep patterns.},

Results: There was a significant discrepancy between self-reported and device-measured parameters of total time in bed (mean difference = 19.8 [51.3] min), sleep onset latency (mean difference = 22.2 [19.5] min), and frequency of awakenings during the night (mean difference = 12.8 [6.8]). Intraclass correlation estimates indicated poor agreement between methods on most parameters, except for total time in bed (intraclass correlation = 0.80). Bland-Altman plots suggested that total time in bed and total sleep time had acceptable levels of agreement and linear regression analyses indicated that sleep onset latency (F = 113.91, B = 21.34, P {\textless} .001), number of awakenings (F = 543.34, B = 1.85, P {\textless} .001), and sleep efficiency (F = 18.39, B = 20.77, P {\textless} .001) had significant proportional bias.

	abstract = {Methods: Sleep diaries and actigraphy data were obtained from 223 adults with fibromyalgia and insomnia (age = 51.53 [standard deviation = 11.90] years; 93\% women) for 14 days. Sleep discrepancy was calculated by subtracting diary from actigraphy estimates of sleep onset latency (SOL-D), wake after sleep onset (WASO-D), and total sleep time (TST-D) for each night. Night-to-night variability in sleep discrepancy was calculated by taking the within-individual standard deviations over 14 days. Participants completed measures of mood, pain, fatigue, sleep/pain medications, nap duration, and caffeine consumption.
Results: Average sleep discrepancies across 14 days were small for all sleep parameters ({\textless} 10 minutes). There was no consistent positive or negative discrepancy. However, sleep discrepancy for any single night was large, with average absolute discrepancies greater than 30 minutes for all sleep parameters. Greater morning pain was associated with larger previous-night WASO-D, although diary and actigraphy estimates of WASO remained fairly concordant. Taking prescribed pain medications, primarily opioids, was associated with greater night-to-night variability in WASO-D and TST-D.
Conclusions: Unlike patients with primary insomnia, patients with comorbid fibromyalgia do not exhibit consistent negative sleep discrepancy; however, there are both substantial positive and negative discrepancies in all sleep parameters at the daily level. Future research is needed to investigate the clinical significance and implications of high night-to-night variability of sleep discrepancy, and the role of prescribed opioid medications in sleep perception.},

	abstract = {Methods: We enrolled 420 patients (age 20–79 y) who underwent polysomnography (PSG). They were divided into three groups based on chief complaints: chronic insomnia (CI, n = 69), patients with both obstructive sleep apnea and insomnia (OSA-I, n = 49) or OSA only (OSA, n = 149). Healthy volunteers were also recruited (normal controls [NC], n = 80). We compared differences in PSG parameters and habitual sleep duration and investigated the discrepancy between objective and subjective total sleep time (TST) and sleep latency among four groups. Subjective TST was defined as sleep time perceived by participants the next morning of PSG.
Results: SP for TST was highest in the OSA group (median 92.9\%), and lowest in the CI group (80.3\%). SP of the NC group (91.4\%) was higher than the CI, but there was no difference between OSA-I and OSA groups. OSA-I had higher depressive mood compared to the OSA group (p {\textless} 0.001). SP was positively associated with the presence of OSA and habitual sleep duration and negatively related to the presence of insomnia and arousal index of PSG. Insomnia patients with (OSA-I) or without OSA (CI) reported the smallest discrepancy between habitual sleep duration and objective TST.
Conclusions: Patients with OSA with or without insomnia have different PSG profiles, which suggests that objective measures of sleep are an important consideration for differentiating subtypes of insomnia and tailoring proper treatment.

	abstract = {Purpose: Sleep is regulated by homeostatic and circadian factors. In addition, psychological factors have a strong modulatory impact on our sleep, but the exact underlying mechanisms are still largely unknown. Here, we examined the role of intentions on subjective and objective sleep parameters. Young healthy sleepers were instructed to voluntarily either worsen or improve their sleep. We predicted that participants would be capable of worsening, but not improving, their sleep compared to a regular sleep condition. In addition, we predicted that the instruction to alter sleep would lead to a higher discrepancy between subjective and objective sleep variables. Participants and Methods: Twenty-two healthy students participated in one adaptation and three experimental nights. Polysomnography and subjective sleep parameters were measured during all four nights. Participants were instructed to sleep regularly (“neutral”), better (“good”) or worse (“bad”) than normal, in a counterbalanced order.
Results: The instruction to sleep “bad” increased objective sleep onset latency and the number of awakings during the night. The effects were stronger on subjective sleep variables, resulting in a higher sleep misperception in the “bad” condition as compared to the other two conditions. The instruction to sleep “good” did not improve sleep nor did it affect sleep misperception.
Conclusion: We conclude that intention is sufficient to impair (but not improve) subjective and objective sleep quality and to increase sleep misperception in healthy young sleepers. Our results have important implications for the understanding of the impact of psychological factors on our sleep.},

	abstract = {Background: Subjective and objective measures of poor sleep in alcoholic insomniacs predict relapse to drinking. Nonalcoholic insomniacs underestimate their total sleep time (TST) and overestimate their sleep onset latency (SOL) and wake time after sleep onset (WASO) compared with polysomnography (PSG). This study evaluated 3 hypotheses: (1) subjective SOL would predict frequency of future drinking; (2) participants would overestimate SOL and WASO and underestimate TST; and (3) higher amounts of over- and underestimates of sleep at baseline would predict worse drinking outcomes prospectively.
Methods: Participants (N 5 18), mean age 44.6 years (Æ13.2), underwent an adaptation night and then 2 nights of PSG 3 weeks apart. They also provided morning estimates of SOL, WASO, TST, and sleep efﬁciency (SE). Following the baseline PSG, participants were followed over 12 weeks. A 2-way ANOVA (nightÂmethod of measuring sleep) compared results and regression analyses predicted drinking. Drinking outcomes were deﬁned as number of days drinking (DD) and number of heavydrinking days (HDD) during 2 consecutive 6-week follow-up periods.
Results: Most participants (72\%) overestimated SOL by a mean of 21.3 (Æ36) minutes compared with PSG [F(1, 14) 5 7.1, po0.03]. Unexpectedly, 89\% underestimated WASO by a mean difference of 48.7 (Æ49) minutes [F(1, 14) 5 15.6, po0.01]. Drinking during the ﬁrst 6-week study period was predicted by both subjective estimates of WASO and their accuracy, whereas drinking during the second 6-week period was predicted by both subjective estimations of sleep and rapid eye movement sleep latency.
Conclusion: Greater subjective accuracy of wakefulness at night provided by the patient predicted drinking during the study. Unlike nonalcoholic insomniacs, this alcoholic sample signiﬁcantly underestimated WASO compared with PSG values. The predictive ability of sleep parameters depended on the selected measure of drinking outcomes and when outcomes were measured. Subjective sleep measures were better predictors of future drinking than corresponding PSG measures.},

	abstract = {Methods: Participants (n = 80) were community adults (mean age = 32.65 years, 63\% female) who completed the time-stamped CSD and used single-channel electroencephalography (EEG) and actigraphy for 7 days at home, then completed a retrospective sleep questionnaire. Total sleep time (TST), sleep efﬁciency (SE), and sleep midpoint were compared using correlations, Bland-Altman plots, and limits of agreement (adjusted for repeated measures).
Results: Correlations between the CSD and all methods on TST were large (rs = .63–.75). Adjusted CSD average TST was 40 minutes greater than with EEG and 31 minutes greater than with actigraphy. Correlations between CSD, actigraphy, and EEG for SE were small (rs = .18), and there was a medium correlation with questionnaire (r =.42). Adjusted CSD average SE was 7\% greater than EEG and 6\% greater than actigraphy; both demonstrated heteroscedasticity. Sleep midpoint correlations between CSD and all methods were large (r = .92–.99). Adjusted CSD was, on average, 6 minutes later than EEG and 1 minute later than actigraphy. Questionnaire-derived sleep parameters demonstrated nonconstant bias; lesser values had positive bias and greater values had negative bias.
Conclusions: The time-stamped CSD led to meaningful overestimations of TSTand SE as measured by objective/inferred methods. However, sleep timing was rather accurately assessed with the CSD in comparison to objective/inferred measures. Researchers should carefully consider which sleep assessment methods are best aligned with their research question and parameters of interest, as methods do not demonstrate complete agreement.},

	abstract = {Methods: In this prospective cohort, women completed a survey of sleep patterns at 6 to 13 weeks’ gestation (visit 1) and again at 22 to 29 weeks’ gestation (visit 3). Additionally, at 16 to 21 weeks (visit 2), a subgroup completed a week-long sleep diary coincident with an actigraphy recording. Weekly averages of self-reported sleep duration and sleep midpoint were calculated. A priori, sleep duration {\textless} 7 hours was defined as “short,” and sleep midpoint after 5:00 am was defined as “late.” The relationship of these sleep abnormalities with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) was determined.
Results: Of the 10,038 women enrolled, sleep survey data were available for 7,524 women at visit 1 and 7,668 women at visit 3. A total of 752 women also provided ≥ 5 days of sleep diary data coincident with actigraphy at visit 2. We did not observe any consistent relationship between self-reported short sleep and HDP or GDM. There was an association between self-reported late sleep midpoint and GDM (visit 1 adjusted odds ratio 1.67, 95\% confidence interval 1.17, 2.38; visit 2 adjusted odds ratio 1.73, 95\% confidence interval 1.23, 2.43). At visit 2, 77.1\% of participants had concordance between their diary and actigraphy for short sleep duration, whereas 94.3\% were concordant for sleep midpoint.
Conclusions: Self-reported sleep midpoint, which is more accurate than self-reported sleep duration, is associated with the risk of GDM.

However, there are controversies in documenting objective indices of disrupted sleep in these patients. The aim of the present study was to assess sleep disturbances in veterans with chronic PTSD, using both subjective and objective assessments.
Methods: Thirty two PTSD patients with complaints of insomnia were evaluated using the Clinician Administrated PTSD Scale version 1 (CAPS) and completed the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) for subjective evaluation of their sleep. For objective evaluation, participants underwent two consecutive overnight actigraphic assessments. Total Sleep Time (TST), Sleep Latency (SL), Sleep Efficiency (SE) and Number of Awakening (NWAK) were measured in all participants.
Results: Participants underestimated TST (p less than 0.0001), SE (p less than 0.0001) as well as NASO (0.03) in the questionnaire compared to the actigraphic assessment and overestimated SL (p less than 0.0001).
Conclusions: Objective sleep parameters do not adversely affect veterans with chronic PTSD. Self-reported sleep disturbance in these patients is not reliable and objective sleep assessments are necessary.},

Several validated questionnaires have been developed to assess sleep, but these tools are lengthy to administer and may be impractical for epidemiologic studies. We examined whether a 3-item sleep questionnaire, similar to those typically used in epidemiologic studies, closely corresponded with objective measures of sleep as assessed using actigraphy monitoring.
Methods: Eligible participants were Western Australian women aged 18 to 80 years. Participants completed a sleep questionnaire, wore a wrist actigraph for 7 nights, and completed a brief daily sleep log. Objective actigraphy measurements for 56 participants were summarized by mean and mode and compared with the subjective reports, using weighted kappa and delta.
Results: Data collected from the questionnaire showed poor agreement with objectively measured sleep, with kappas ranging from −0.19 to 0.14.
Conclusions: Our results indicate that sleep questions typically used in epidemiologic studies do not closely correspond with objective measures of sleep as assessed using actigraphy. The ﬁndings have implications for studies that have used such sleep questions. A means of appropriately measuring sleep as a risk factor in epidemiologic studies remains to be determined.},

	abstract = {Methods: At-home ambulatory polysomnograms (PSGs) of 31 people with insomnia were recorded. Participants performed a time estimation task and completed the Pre Sleep Arousal Scale (PSAS). Based on previous modelling of the relationship between objectively measured sleep fragmentation and sleep onset misperception, the subjective sleep onset was estimated for each participant as the start of the ﬁrst uninterrupted sleep bout longer than 30 min. Subsequently, the component of misperception not explained by sleep fragmentation was calculated as the residual error between estimated sleep onset and perceived sleep onset. This residual error was correlated with individual time estimation task results and PSAS scores.
Results: A negative correlation between time estimation task results and the residual error of the sleep onset model was found, indicating that participants who overestimated a time interval during the day also overestimated their sleep onset latency (SOL). No correlation was found between PSAS scores and residual error.
Conclusions: Interindividual variations of sleep architecture possibly obscure the correlation of sleep onset misperception with time estimation and pre sleep arousal, especially in small groups. Therefore, we used a previously proposed model to account for the inﬂuence of sleep fragmentation. Results indicate that time estimation is associated with sleep onset misperception. Since sleep onset misperception appears to be a general characteristic of insomnia, understanding the underlying mechanisms is probably important for understanding and treating insomnia.},

              . Sleep disturbances are a key feature of major depression. Electroconvulsive treatment (ECT) may improve polysomnography-assessed sleep characteristics, but its short-term effects on actigraphy-assessed and subjective sleep characteristics are unknown. We therefore aimed to assess the effects of ECT on subjective and objective sleep parameters in a proof-of-principle study.
              Methods
              . We assessed subjective and objective sleep parameters in 12 severely depressed patients up to 5 consecutive days during their ECT course, corresponding to a total of 43 nights (including 19 ECT sessions). The 12 patients were 83\% female and on average 62 (standard deviation (SD) 14) years old and had an average MADRS score of 40 at baseline (SD 21).
              Results
              . Subjective and objective sleep parameters were not directly affected by ECT. The subjective sleep efficiency parameter was similar on the day after ECT and other days. ECT did not affect the number of errors in the Sustained Attention to Response Task. Patients subjectively underestimated their total sleep time by 1.4 hours (

              . ECT did not affect subjective and actigraphy-assessed sleep in the short term. Depressed patients profoundly underestimated their sleep duration.},

	abstract = {Background:  The concept of misperception of sleep refers to the estimated discrepancy between subjective and objective measures of sleep. This has been assessed only in a few prior studies in individuals with Bipolar Disorder (BD) as compared to Healthy Controls (HC) and with mixed results.
Methods:  We assessed a sample of 133 euthymic individuals with BD and 63 HC for retrospective subjective (Pitts‑burgh Sleep Quality Index) and objective (21 days of actigraphy recording) measures of total sleep time, sleep latency and sleep efficiency. We first investigated the correlations between these subjective and objective measures in the two groups. We then compared individuals with BD and HC for the absolute values of the differences between subjective and objective sleep parameters, used as a proxy of the magnitude of misperception of sleep. Finally, we undertook regression analyses to assess associations between clinical groups, core demographics, clinical factors and misperception of sleep.
Results:  The correlation coefficients between subjective and objective measures of sleep did not differ between groups (total sleep time: rho = .539 in BD and rho = .584 in HC; sleep latency: rho = .190 in BD and rho = .125 in HC; sleep efficiency: rho = .166 in BD and rho = .222 in HC). Individuals with BD did not differ from HC in the magnitude of misperception of total sleep time, sleep latency nor sleep efficiency. Individuals with BD type 1 misperceived their sleep efficiency significantly more than individuals with BD type 2, with no further difference between BD type 1 and BD type 2 regarding sleep latency and sleep duration misperceptions. Three factors (age, symptoms of obstruc‑tive sleep apnea, and mild depressive symptoms), were the main contributors to the magnitude of misperception of sleep.
Conclusions:  Misperception of sleep was not associated with a diagnosis of BD. In this sample, mild depressive symptoms, older age, or symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea may be related to greater sleep misperception. In that case, the reliability of subjective measures may decrease as the misperception of sleep increases. This study may help guide clinicians in selecting the best approach for assessing sleep (objective versus subjective measures) in individu‑als with BD.},

We also compared the relative spectral power of sleep EEG among MDD (n = 40), PI (n = 19), and NSC (n = 23) groups. SOD of SOL in MDD patients was positively correlated with relative sigma (r = 0.622, p corrected {\textless} 0.001), beta power (r = 0.559, p corrected = 0.002), and alpha power (r = 0.469, p corrected = 0.024) in the ﬁrst NREM sleep period. There was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence of sleep EEG power spectra among the three groups. SOD was positively correlated with high frequency EEG in MDD. High frequency EEG power is thought to be associated with hyperarousal and memory consolidation, and future larger-scale studies may further elucidate the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying SOD of sleep onset duration.},

	abstract = {Objectives: Bipolar disorder is an illness characterized by sleep and circadian disturbance, and monitoring sleep in this population may signal an impending mood change. Actigraphy is an important clinical and research tool for examining sleep, but has not yet been systematically compared to polysomnography or sleep diary in bipolar disorder. The present study compares actigraphy, polysomnography, and sleep diary estimates of ﬁve standard sleep parameters in individuals with bipolar disorder and matched controls across two nights of assessment.
Methods: Twenty-seven individuals who met diagnostic criteria for bipolar disorder type I or II and were currently between mood episodes, along with 27 matched controls with no history of psychopathology or sleep disturbance, underwent two nights of research laboratory monitoring. Sleep was estimated via polysomnography, actigraphy, and sleep diary.
Results: Over the 108 nights available for comparison, sleep parameter estimates from actigraphy and polysomnography were highly correlated and did not diﬀer between the two groups or across the two nights for sleep onset latency, wake after sleep onset, number of awakenings, total sleep time, or sleep eﬃciency percentage. The medium wake threshold algorithm in the actigraphy software was the most concordant with polysomnography and diaries across the ﬁve sleep parameters. Concordance between actigraphy, polysomnography, and sleep diary was largely independent of insomnia presence and medication use.
Conclusions: Actigraphy is a valid tool for estimating sleep length and fragmentation in bipolar disorder.},

Cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia improves sleep quality and decreases subjective–objective sleep discrepancy. This study describes differences between older adults with insomnia and controls in sleep discrepancy, and tests the hypothesis that reduced sleep discrepancy following cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia correlates with the magnitude of symptom improvement reported by older adults with insomnia. Participants were 63 adults {\textgreater}60 years of age with insomnia, and 51 controls. At baseline, participants completed sleep diaries for 7 days while wearing wrist actigraphs. After receiving cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia, insomnia patients repeated this sleep assessment. Sleep discrepancy variables were calculated by subtracting actigraphic sleep onset latency and wake after sleep onset from respective self-reported estimates, pre- and post-treatment. Mean level and night-to-night variability in sleep discrepancy were investigated. Baseline sleep discrepancies were compared between groups. Pre–post-treatment changes in Insomnia Severity Index score and sleep discrepancy variables were investigated within older adults with insomnia. Sleep discrepancy was signiﬁcantly greater and more variable across nights in older adults with insomnia than controls, P ≤ 0.001 for all. Treatment with cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia was associated with signiﬁcant reduction in the Insomnia Severity Index score that correlated with changes in mean level and night-to-night variability in wake after sleep onset discrepancy, P {\textless} 0.001 for all.

Thirty-seven subjects had a polysomnography prior to a work day. After rising they completed the Karolinska Sleep Diary. A factor analysis of the diary yielded two factors: (1) a sleep-quality index (SQI) related to the initiation and maintenance of sleep, and (2) a second factor related to difficulties waking-up and to whether sleep was recuperative and sufficient. The strongest predictors (multiple regression) of the sleep quality index was slow-wave sleep (SWS) and sleep efficiency [and variables related to sleep continuity - total sleep time (TST) and the amount of stage 01. The obtained results were in agreement with previous laboratory findings. It was concluded that sleep quality seems to be a matter of depth of sleep and sleep continuity.},

Polysomnography (PSG) is the gold standard diagnostic tool but is not easily available in all jurisdictions. We aimed to evaluate various questionnaires and wrist actigraphy as screening tools for sleep disorders in the context of ESKD, by comparing results to unattended home PSG results. Materials and methods: Consecutive patients with advanced CKD or ESKD were recruited and assessed using a combination of self-reported instruments (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, International Restless Legs Questionnaire, Short Form 36), wrist actigraphy, and unattended home PSG. The utility of the questionnaires was summarized. Agreement between actig­ raphy and PSG scores was assessed. Results: There was a high prevalence of self-reported sleep disturbance among the 54 participants. The questionnaires had low positive and negative predictive values for their corresponding PSG-measured variables. There were no significant differences between paired PSG and actigraphy summary results for sleep efficiency and time spent awake after sleep onset (n = 27 paired comparisons). Conclusion: Commonly used screening questionnaires do not accurately predict sleep disorders in the context of advanced CKD or ESKD. Wrist actigraphy accurately identifies those with low sleep efficiency and long time spent awake after sleep onset, who are likely to have the highest diagnostic yield with PSG. Neither approach obviates the need for PSG for accurate diagnosis of sleep disorders in this population.},

Objective: To evaluate the association between sleep duration, obesity and serum lipid proﬁle in the youth population.
Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional population-based study with students recruited from primary and secondary schools in Hong Kong. Anthropometric measurements, fasting lipid proﬁles and validated questionnaires on sleep duration were performed. A subgroup (n = 138) was randomly selected for both questionnaires and actigraphy to assess the agreement between subjective and objective measurements of sleep duration.
Results: We studied 2053 healthy children and adolescents aged 6–20 years. Their mean ages were 13.0 ± 3.3 (boys) and 13.6 ± 3.3 (girls) years. The average sleep duration during schooldays, weekends, and long holidays was 8.0 ± 1.1, 9.6 ± 1.2, and 9.8 ± 1.2 h in boys and 7.7 ± 1.1, 9.9 ± 1.2, and 10.1 ± 1.2 h in girls, respectively. Using logistic regression, age, and pubertal stage were associated with obesity in secondary school students, whereas male gender and short sleep duration were associated with obesity in primary school children. In secondary school children, those with long sleep duration, as compared to those with short sleep duration, were signiﬁcantly associated with reduced risk to have high TC and LDL-C levels after adjustment for age, gender, BMI, and pubertal stage. There was no significant association between sleep duration and lipid levels in primary school children.
Conclusion: Reduced sleep duration was associated with obesity and atherogenic dyslipidemia in young school children in Hong Kong.},

	abstract = {Objective Subjective reports of patients with insomnia often show a discrepancy with their objective assessments of sleep. We aimed to assess subjective-objective sleep discrepancy in subjects with insomnia disorder as well as the psychological factors associated with the discrepancy.
Methods This study is a secondary analysis of the baseline data of a randomized controlled study on 110 adults aged 18 years to 59 years with insomnia disorder. Subjective reports on sleep and the objective measures acquired by an overnight polysomnography were used to measure the sleep discrepancy. Smartphone Addiction Proneness Scale (SAPS), Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), beck anxiety inventory (BAI), and Global Assessment of Recent Stress (GARS) were used to evaluate the psychological factors associated with the sleep discrepancy.
Results Mean total sleep time (TST) discrepancy of the participants was -81.65±97.41 minutes. Multivariable logistic regression analyses revealed that age (adjusted OR=1.07, 95\% CI=1.01–1.13, p=0.027), years of education (adjusted OR=0.69, 95\% CI=0.48–0.91, p=0.017), and smartphone addiction proneness (adjusted OR=1.14, 95\% CI=1.04–1.27, p=0.008) were independent predictors of TST misperception. Mean sleep onset latency (SOL) discrepancy of the participants was 41.28±45.01 minutes. Only anxiety was an independent predictor of SOL misperception (adjusted OR=1.16, 95\% CI=1.05–1.31, p=0.006).
Conclusion The present study provides empirical evidence to increase our understanding of the various factors that are associated with subjective-objective sleep discrepancy. Screening insomnia patients with smartphone addiction proneness may help predict the potential discrepancy between the patients’ subjective reports and objective measures of sleep duration.},

	abstract = {Background: Sleep is related to various kinds of health outcomes. Many studies traditionally collect data on sleep using questionnaires or sleep diaries. An increasing popular alternative is a wrist-worn device. The accuracy of these devices is uncertain, and assessment of this accuracy is important.
Introduction: The purpose of this study is to compare consensus sleep diary (CSD) and an actigraphy-based wrist-worn device (Fitbit AltaÔ [Fitbit, San Francisco, CA]) measurements of total sleep time (TST), sleep onset latency, wake time after sleep onset, number of awakenings, and sleep efficiency. Materials and Methods: Ten healthy young adults (50\% female, 100\% Asian) in the age range between 20 to 24 years old wore a Fitbit Alta around their nondominated hand during seven consecutive nights. The participants also filled in a CSD every day.
Results: On average, the wrist-worn device (Fitbit Alta) recorded a TST per night of 437.15 min, which is 5.46 min shorter on average than the CSD recorded (442.61 min). Bland–Altman plots indicate that there is large variance in the sleep recorded between FitbitÔ (Fitbit, San Francisco, CA) and CSD. For example, Fitbit recorded 2.15 more awakenings per night than CSD, which is equal to 13.09 min on average longer wake time after sleep onset.
Conclusion: Fitbit and CSD show significant differences in recording sleep. We find that for most sleep metrics, the level of disagreement is small enough for the devices to be interchangeably used except for recording wakes during the night.},

Results: Subjective-objective sleep discrepancy existed in all 4 groups, including the NSC group. Controlling for age, sex, mental health conditions, sleep apnea severity, and objectively measured sleep time, the presence of self-reported insomnia had the strongest association with sleep discrepancy. In patients with insomnia, sleep onset latency was overestimated (7.8 ± 36.8 min in the IS group; P {\textless} .001 when compared to the NSC and OSA groups), with the largest differences seen in the comorbid IS + OSA group (15.0 ± 56.8 min). Insomnia conferred the most negative impact on QOL, with the combined IS + OSA group reporting the lowest QOL.
Conclusions: Self-reported insomnia is associated with sleep discrepancy and negative QOL. Those with comorbid OSA reported the greatest sleep discrepancy and the lowest QOL. Future research is warranted to further understand individual profiles of misperception and insomnia phenotypes.},

	abstract = {Misperception of Sleep Onset Latency, often found in Primary Insomnia, has been cited to be inﬂuenced by hyperarousal, reﬂected in EEG- and ECG-related indices. The aim of this retrospective study was to examine the association between Central Nervous System (i.e. EEG) and Autonomic Nervous System activity in the Sleep Onset Period and the ﬁrst NREM sleep cycle in Primary Insomnia (n = 17) and healthy controls (n = 11). Furthermore, the study examined the inﬂuence of elevated EEG and Autonomic Nervous System activity on Stage2 sleep-protective mechanisms (K-complexes and sleep spindles). Conﬁrming previous ﬁndings, the Primary Insomnia-group overestimated Sleep Onset Latency and this overestimation was correlated with elevated EEG activity. A higher amount of beta EEG activity during the Sleep Onset Period was correlated with the appearance of K-complexes immediately followed by a sleep spindle in the Primary Insomnia-group. This can be interpreted as an extra attempt to protect sleep continuity or as a failure of the sleep-protective role of the K-complex by fast EEG frequencies following within one second. The strong association found between K-alpha (K-complex within one second followed by 8–12 Hz EEG activity) in Stage2 sleep and a lower parasympathetic Autonomic Nervous System dominance (less high frequency HR) in Slow-wave sleep, further assumes a state of hyperarousal continuing through sleep in Primary Insomnia.},

	abstract = {Background: Complaints of unrefreshing sleep are a prominent component of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS); yet, polysomnographic studies have not consistently documented sleep abnormalities in CFS patients. We conducted this study to determine whether alterations in objective sleep characteristics are associated with subjective measures of poor sleep quality in persons with CFS.
Methods: We examined the relationship between perceived sleep quality and polysomnographic measures of nighttime and daytime sleep in 35 people with CFS and 40 non-fatigued control subjects, identified from the general population of Wichita, Kansas and defined by empiric criteria. Perceived sleep quality and daytime sleepiness were assessed using clinical sleep questionnaires. Objective sleep characteristics were assessed by nocturnal polysomnography and daytime multiple sleep latency testing.
Results: Participants with CFS reported unrefreshing sleep and problems sleeping during the preceding month significantly more often than did non-fatigued controls. Participants with CFS also rated their quality of sleep during the overnight sleep study as significantly worse than did control subjects. Control subjects reported significantly longer sleep onset latency than latency to fall asleep as measured by PSG and MSLT. There were no significant differences in sleep pathology or architecture between subjects with CFS and control subjects.
Conclusion: People with CFS reported sleep problems significantly more often than control subjects. Yet, when measured these parameters and sleep architecture did not differ between the two subject groups. A unique finding requiring further study is that control, but not CFS subjects, significantly over reported sleep latency suggesting CFS subjects may have an increased appreciation of sleep behaviour that may contribute to their perception of sleep problems.},

	abstract = {In research and clinical contexts, parents’ report and sleep diary ﬁlled in by parents are often used to characterize sleep-wake rhythms in children. The current study aimed to investigate children self-perception of their sleep, by comparing sleep diaries ﬁlled in by themselves, actigraphic sleep recordings, and parental subjective estimation. Eighty children aged 8–9 years wore actigraph wristwatches and completed sleep diaries for 7 days, while their parents completed a sleepschedule questionnaire about their child’ sleep. The level of agreement and correlation between sleep parameters derived from these three methods were measured. Sleep parameters were considered for the whole week and school days and weekends separately and a comparison between children with high and low sleep efﬁciency was carried out. Compared to actigraphy, children overestimated their sleep duration by 92 min and demonstrated signiﬁcant difﬁculty to assess the amount of time they spent awake during the night. The estimations were better in children with high sleep efﬁciency compared to those with low sleep efﬁciency. Parents estimated that their children went to bed 36 min earlier and obtained 36.5 min more sleep than objective estimations with actigraphy. Children and parents’ accuracy to estimate sleep parameters was different during school days and weekends, supporting the importance of analyzing separately school days and weekends when measuring sleep in children. Actigraphy and sleep diaries showed good agreement for bedtime and wake-up time, but not for SOL and WASO. A satisfactory agreement for TST was observed during school days only, but not during weekends. Even if parents provided more accurate sleep estimation than children, parents’ report, and actigraphic data were weakly correlated and levels of agreement were insufﬁcient. These results suggested that sleep diary completed by children provides interesting measures of selfperception, while actigraphy may provide additional information about nocturnal wake times. Sleep diary associated with actigraphy could be an interesting tool to evaluate parameters that could contribute to adjust subjective perception to objective sleep values.},

	abstract = {Objective: To examine the distribution, consistency, and correlates of sleep time perceptions in primary insomnia sufferers and normal sleepers across settings (laboratory and home).
Methods: Fifty-two middle-aged and older insomnia sufferers and 49 matched normal sleepers underwent multiple nights of laboratory and home polysomnography (PSG) and provided concurrent subjective estimates of their sleep. Descriptive statistics, cluster analyses, and inferential tests were used to examine the nature of sleep time perceptions, identify subgroups with distinctive patterns such as perceptions, and explore factors that may contribute to these subgroups’ distinctive sleep perceptions.
Results: Consistent with previous studies, the insomnia sufferers, as a group, showed a greater tendency to underestimate the time they slept than did the normal sleepers, but the accuracy of sleep time perceptions varied widely within each sample. Correlational analyses showed that study participants in each sample showed a moderate level of consistency in how accurately they estimated sleep time across nights. Subsequent cluster analyses conducted to identify subgroups with distinctive patterns of sleep time perceptions yielded four subgroups within the insomnia sample and three subgroups within the normal sleeper sample. Although the sleep setting signiﬁcantly affected sleep perceptions for one insomnia subgroup, both laboratory and home objective – subjective sleep comparisons provided similar impressions regarding the relative accuracy of each subgroup’s nocturnal sleep/wake perceptions. Finally, varying patterns of subgroup differences were noted across several common psychometric measures.
Conclusions: The underestimation of sleep time is not a generic characteristic that separates all insomnia sufferers from normal sleepers. Sleep setting, personality traits, and perhaps constitutional factors appear to inﬂuence perceptions of sleep and wake time duration. q 2003 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Results: At baseline, objective measures estimated lower SOL, higher TST, and higher SE than diaries (ps {\textless} 0.05). Compared to PSG, actigraphic estimates were higher for SOL and lower for WASO (ps {\textless} 0.05). Repeated measures ANOVAs were conducted for the CBT-I group (n = 15), and significant method by time interactions indicated that the assessment methods differed in their sensitivity to detect treatment-related changes. PSG values did not change significantly for any sleep parameters. However, diaries showed improvements in SOL, WASO, and SE, and actigraphy also detected the WASO and SE improvements (ps {\textless} 0.05).
Conclusions: Actigraphy was generally more concordant with PSG than with diaries, which are the recommended assessment for diagnosing insomnia. However, actigraphy showed greater sensitivity to treatment-related changes than PSG; PSG failed to detect any improvements, but actigraphy demonstrated changes in WASO and SE, which were also found with diaries. In comorbid insomnia/fibromyalgia, actigraphy may therefore have utility in measuring treatment outcomes.},

	abstract = {Background and PurposezzDiscrepancies between objectively measured sleep and subjective sleep perception in patients with insomnia have been reported. However, few studies have investigated sleep-state misperception in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). We designed this study to 1) delineate the factors that could affect this discrepancy and 2) infer an underlying mechanism in patients with OSA.
MethodszzWe recruited patients who visited our sleep clinic for the evaluation of their snoring and/or observed OSA. Participants completed a structured questionnaire and underwent overnight polysomnography. On the following day, five sessions of the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) were applied. We divided the patients into two groups: normal sleep perception and abnormal perception. The abnormal-perception group included patients whose perceived total sleep time was less than 80\% of that measured in polysomnography.
ResultszzFifty OSA patients were enrolled from a university hospital sleep clinic. Excessive daytime sleepiness, periodic limb movement index (PLMI), and the presence of dreaming were positively associated with poor sleep perception. REM sleep near the sleep termination exerted important effects. Respiratory disturbance parameters were not related to sleep perception. There was a prolongation in the sleep latency in the first session of the MSLT and we suspected that a delayed sleep phase occurred in poor-sleep perceivers.
ConclusionszzAs an objectively good sleep does not match the subjective good-sleep perception in OSA, physicians should keep in mind that OSA patients who perceive that they have slept well does not mean that their OSA is less severe.},

	abstract = {Cortical hyperarousal is higher in insomnia sufferers (INS) than in good sleepers (GS) and could be related to an alteration in sleep protection mechanisms, like reduced density or altered characteristics in sleep spindles. The deficient sleep protection mechanisms might in turn enhance underestimation of sleep. This study’s objective was to document sleep spindles characteristics in INS compared with GS and to investigate their potential role in sleep consolidation and misperception. Seventeen individuals with paradoxical insomnia (PARA-I), 24 individuals with psychophysiological insomnia (PSY-I), and 29 GS completed four consecutive polysomnographic nights in laboratory. Sleep spindles were detected automatically during stage 2 and SWS (3-4) on night 3. Number, density, duration, frequency, and amplitude of sleep spindles were calculated. A misperception index was used to determine the degree of discrepancy between subjective and objective total sleep times. Kruskal-Wallis

              tests and post hoc tests revealed that PARA-I had significantly shorter sleep spindles than GS but that PSY-I and GS did not differ on spindles length. A standard multiple regression model revealed that neither sleep spindles characteristics nor objective sleep measures were predictive of sleep misperception. A longer duration of spindles could reflect a higher gating process but this hypothesis still needs to be confirmed in replication studies.},

	abstract = {Objective: The objective of this study was to determine the association between sleep and depression using both self-reported (subjective) and actigraphic (objective) sleep traits.
Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 175 female primary caregivers of children with disabilities receiving care at a rehabilitation center in Punta Arenas, Chile. The eight-item Patient Health Questionnaire was used to ascertain participants’ depression status. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index was used to define subjective, or perceived, sleep quality. Wrist-worn actigraph monitors, worn for seven consecutive nights, were used to characterize objective sleep quality and disturbances. Interviewer-administered questionnaires were used to collect information on sociodemographic and lifestyle factors. Linear regression models were fit using continuous sleep parameters as the dependent variables and depression status as the independent variable. Multivariable models were adjusted for body mass index, marital status, smoking status, education level, and children’s disabilities.
Results: Using an eight-item Patient Health Questionnaire score \$10, 26.3\% of participants presented with depression. Depressed women were more likely to self-report overall poorer (subjective) sleep compared to non-depressed women; however, differences in sleep were not consistently noted using actigraphic (objective) sleep traits. Among the depressed, both sleep duration and total time in bed were significantly underestimated. In multivariable models, depression was negatively associated with sleep duration using both subjective (β=−0.71, standard error [SE] =0.25; P=0.006) and objective sleep (β=−0.42, SE =0.19; P=0.026).
Conclusion: The association between sleep and depression differed comparing subjective and objective methods of assessment. Research strategies allowing for the integration of both perceived and objective measures of sleep traits are encouraged.},

Patients and methods: Fourteen patients with mild to severe TBI were compared to 14 healthy good sleepers. Subjective measures of insomnia were obtained from a sleep diary (morning questionnaire), and objective measures from two nights of polysomnography (PSG).
Results: All subjective measures of sleep revealed signiﬁcant sleep disturbance in the TBI group. TBI patients with insomnia have a tendency to overestimate their sleep disturbance compared to PSG measures of sleep. With PSG, 10 out of 14 participants with TBI could be deﬁned as having objective insomnia. Nonetheless, when groups were compared, no signiﬁcant differences were found on sleep continuity variables, although large effect sizes were seen for several measures suggesting sleep fragmentation. In terms of sleep architecture, no signiﬁcant differences were found in the percentage of stage 2, slow-wave (stages 3 and 4), and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, but a higher proportion of stage 1 sleep was found in the TBI participants. When patients using psychotropic medication were excluded, TBI patients were found to have more awakenings lasting longer than 5 min and a shorter REM sleep latency.
Conclusions: These results are similar to those found in patients with either primary insomnia or insomnia related to depression. q 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Objective: We aimed to find how self-reported sleep (measured by the St. Mary’s Hospital Sleep Questionnaire) in postmenopausal women having hot flash activity was related to objective sleep (actigraphy), psychological and somatic symptoms [Women’s Health Questionnaire (WHQ)], and cognitive test performance (computerized tests). A secondary aim was to find if self-reported sleep showed expected correlations with hyperarousal (Hyperarousal Scale). Design: Drug trial baseline data from 88 healthy, postmenopausal women were retrospectively analyzed. Multivariate regression was used to adjust for confounder variables and test whether differences in self-reported sleep measures were systematically associated with differences in objective sleep, WHQ symptom measures, or cognitive test performance scores.
Results: Increased self-report scores for low sleep quality were associated with an increased risk of WHQ symptoms and reduced cognitive test performance. Self-reported sleep measures showed little correlation with their analogous objective measures. Self-reported low sleep quality proved most closely associated with the WHQ symptoms of tiredness, clumsiness, and difficulty concentrating. Women whose self-reported sleep-onset latency times were longer than the median overestimated their objective sleep onset time by 30 min, whereas the other women underestimated theirs by 15 min (P {\textless} 0.0001). Women whose self-reported total sleep was longer or shorter than the median, respectively, underestimated objective sleep times by 9 and 71 min (P {\textless} 0.0001). High hyperarousal scores were associated with underestimations of objective sleep.
Conclusion: Self-reports of lower sleep quality were associated with increased WHQ psychological and somatic symptom measures and decreased cognitive test performance more than with differences in objective sleep. Self-reported trouble sleeping may signal problems independent from objectively low sleep quality, such as subjective distress or diminished cognitive function.},

The mean age of the patients was 56.9 years, and the mean duration of insomnia morbidity was 8.9 years. Each received individual combined CBT treatments consisting of stimulus control, sleep reduction, cognitive therapy and sleep hygiene education over a period of 1 month. Methods: Just before the CBT and after its completion, sleep measurements were conducted that involved (i) sleep logs, Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep Scale (DBAS), and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI); (ii) actigraphy measurement; (iii) dissociation between subjective and objective evaluation of sleep calculated from sleep logs and actigraphy results; and (iv) correlation between DBAS and the aforementioned sleep parameters. Because the intention was to focus on patients’ incorrect cognition about sleep, the deﬁnition ‘changes in dissociation between the sleep log and actigraphically measured sleep’ was used as the primary outcome and ‘changes in DBAS score’ as the secondary outcome. Results: After the CBT the following was found: (i) underestimation by PPI patients of the objective evaluation of sleep; (ii) a decrease in the dissociation between the subjective and objective evaluation of sleep; (iii) improvement of the DBAS; and (iv) improvement of sleep logs and actigraphy measurements. Moreover, there was a correlation between the improvement of PSQI, sleep logs and DBAS. Conclusion: CBT for insomnia is able to redress incorrect cognition about sleep, leading to improvement of the disorder.},

	abstract = {Objectives: Comparisons of subjective and objective sleep measures have shown discrepancies between reported sleep and polysomnography (PSG) in non-drug dependent individuals with and without insomnia. Sleep may affect behavioral and physiologic aspects of drug abuse and dependence; patients in methadone maintenance therapy (MMT) for opioid dependence frequently report sleep problems. Whether subjective sleep reﬂects objective sleep in MMT patients is unknown. We undertook these analyses to establish the correlations among subjective and objective sleep measures in MMT patients. Methods: We compared one week of daily sleep diaries, one night of home PSG, a questionnaire completed the morning after PSG, and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Inventory (PSQI) as well as demographics and drug use measures in 62 MMT patients with disturbed sleep (PSQI score {\textgreater} 5). Results: Subjective and objective sleep durations were similar in this sample; average sleep times for the diary, morning questionnaire, and PSG were 340, 323, and 332 min, respectively. Average diary sleep time, subjective ratings of feeling rested, and PSG sleep efﬁciency were correlated signiﬁcantly with PSQI score. Age was inversely correlated with PSG sleep time. Participants whose urine toxicology showed benzodiazapine use reported signiﬁcantly longer sleep times on the morning questionnaire. Conclusions: Objective sleep measures conﬁrm subjective measures in MMT patients with disturbed sleep. The high prevalence of sleep complaints in this population likely reﬂects pathology rather than sleep misperception. Both objective and subjective measures are useful in research and clinical settings for assessing sleep in opioid-dependent patients.},

Some individuals are likely to be more vulnerable than others to noise-related sleep disturbances, potentially as a result of increased pre-sleep cognitive arousal. The aim of the present study was to examine the relationships between pre-sleep cognitive arousal and sleep misperception. Sixteen healthy sleepers participated in this naturalistic, observational study. Three nights of sleep were measured using actigraphy, and each 15-s epoch was classiﬁed as sleep or wake. Bedside noise was recorded, and each 15-s segment was classiﬁed as containing noise or no noise and matched to actigraphy. Participants completed measures of habitual pre-sleep cognitive and somatic arousal and noise sensitivity. Presleep cognitive and somatic arousal levels were negatively associated with subjective–objective total sleep time discrepancy (p {\textless} 0.01). There was an association between sleep/wake and noise presence/absence in the ﬁrst and last 90 min of sleep (p {\textless} 0.001). These results indicate that higher levels of habitual pre-sleep arousal are associated with a greater degree of sleep misperception, and even in healthy sleepers, objective sleep is vulnerable to habitual bedside noise.},

Design: Total sleep time and sleep onset latency obtained from unattended home PSGs were compared to sleep times obtained from a questionnaire completed before the PSG and a Morning Survey completed the morning after the PSG. Participants: A total of 2,113 subjects who were ≥ 40 years of age were included in this analysis. Measures and Results: Subjects were 53\% female, 75\% Caucasian, and 38\% obese. The mean habitual sleep time (HABTST), morning estimated sleep time (AMTST), and PSG total sleep times (PSGTST) were 422 min, 379 min, and 363 min, respectively. The mean habitual sleep onset latency, morning estimated sleep onset latency, and PSG sleep onset latency were 17.0 min, 21.8 min, and 16.9 min, respectively. Models adjusting for related demographic factors showed that HABTST and AMTST differ signiﬁcantly from PSGTST by 61 and 18 minutes, respectively. Obese and higher educated people reported less sleep time than their counterparts. Similarly, small but signiﬁcant differences were seen for sleep latency.

Some physical activity monitors (PAMs) provide data about sleep quality for the user, but there are scarce data concerning validity and usability of these measurements. This study compared the data of sleep parameters generated by a PAM with the polysomnography (PSG).
Methods: In 2016, data of 26 patients in two consecutive PSGs as well as in two daytime and nighttime measurements with a PAM according to physical activity and sleep quality were collected. Furthermore, sleep quality, using the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI), daytime fatigue, using the multidimensional fatigue inventory (MFI20) and additionally data of a sleep diary were collected.
Results: There were positive correlations of both methods with respect to total sleep time (TST) (r = 0.76, P {\textless} 0.01) and sleep efficiency (r = 0.71, P {\textless} 0.01). Data analysis over two nights showed that over 90\% of the TST (95\% confidence interval (CI) -1.59 to 0.82) and of the sleep efficiency (95\% CI -8.28 to 15.51) were within the limits of agreement. The analysis of the PSQI and the sleep efficiency of the PAM showed no significant correlations. The daytime fatigue correlated negatively with the physical activity (r = -0.72, P {\textless} 0.01).
Conclusion: The sleep efficiency and TST measured with the PAM sufficiently reflect the PSG sleep parameters and the subjects’ subjective feelings. At the same time, PAM results are also correlated with the subjectively perceived quality of sleep. Further investigations to assess the long-term results are pending.},

Overestimation of sleep has also been reported in the past, with no clear reference to corresponding polysomnographic (PSG) ﬁndings or its clinical signiﬁcance. Patients and methods: Patients were recruited from the general population undergoing a PSG assessment for a cross-sectional retrospective study in a sleep clinic aﬃliated with a tertiary health center.
Results: A group of patients who overestimated their sleep had mostly non-discriminating PSG ﬁndings when compared to patients who underestimated their sleep, and correct estimators. The only parameters that were signiﬁcantly diﬀerent were objective sleep duration and eﬃciency, and, importantly, respective multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) results. The patients who overestimated their sleep had a mean MSLT result of 7.8 min, which indicates moderate daytime sleepiness. Patients who underestimated their sleep and correct estimators had the respective MSLT results of {\textgreater}10 min, making a statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerence.
Conclusion: The authors identiﬁed a condition opposite the previously described sleep underestimation, and named it ‘positive sleep state misperception’ (PSSM). The condition is characterised by a gross overestimation of sleep. Inadequate sleep results in a clinically signiﬁcant excessive daytime sleepiness, which patients were not able to predict. The authors propose a new model that incorporates both ends of the sleep misperception spectrum.},

In this study, we compared sleep parameters obtained from two measurement methods and investigated their intrinsic biases. The results revealed a strong agreement between two methods for recording sleep offset times, but a relatively poor agreement for parameters that include substantial periods of transition between sleep and wake states. Overall, self-reported sleep durations were substantially longer than actigraphic estimates (mean bias of − 30.6 min; limits of agreement − 95.9 to 34.8 min), and the discrepancy was mainly caused by differences in two methods to track sleep onset latency and Wake-up After Sleep Onset (WASO). Based on a customised activity log, a strong positive correlation (rho = 0.75, p {\textless} .001) between selfreport and actigraphy was observed for sleep duration estimates, which confirmed the effectiveness of the ac­ tivity log in field studies. Between two participant groups with different work schedules, the agreement between self-report and actigraphy was consistently better for day workers than watch keepers. The findings inform future sleep research planning that involves naval personnel in field settings.},

Much of this research is based on subjective reports from trauma survivors; however, objective measures of sleep-related impairment have yielded ﬁndings inconsistent with self-report data.

The current study examined PTSD-related sleep disturbance in a female interpersonal violence cohort with full PTSD diagnoses (N¼51) assessing subjective (global and daily diary measures) and objective (actigraphy) sleep measures concurrently. PTSD severity was positively associated with global, subjective reports of sleep impairment and insomnia. Subjective measures of sleep (including global sleep impairment, insomnia, and daily sleep diary reports of total sleep time, sleep efﬁciency, and sleep onset latency) were moderately to strongly correlated. However, no signiﬁcant correlations between subjective and objective reports of sleep impairment were found in this cohort. Analyses demonstrated an overall elevation in subjectively reported sleep impairment when compared to objective measurement assessed concurrently. Findings demonstrate a lack of agreement between subjective and objective measurements of sleep in a PTSD-positive female cohort, suggesting objective and subjective sleep impairments are distinct sleep parameters that do not necessarily directly co-vary.},

	abstract = {Background:  Power spectral analysis (PSA) is one of the most commonly-used EEG markers of cortical hyperarousal, and can help to understand subjective–objective sleep discrepancy (SOD). Age is associated with decreased sleep EEG activity; however, the PSA of young adults is currently limited. Thus, this study aimed to examine the correlation of spectral EEG power with total sleep time (TST) misperception in young patients.
Methods:  Forty-seven young adults were recruited and underwent a polysomnography recording in a sleep laboratory. Clinical records and self-report questionnaires of all patients were collected, and were used to categorize patients into a good sleeper (GS) group (n = 10), insomnia with a low mismatch group (IWLM, n = 19) or participant with a high mismatch group (IWHM, n = 18). PSA was applied to the first 6 h of sleep.
Results:  IWHM patients exhibited a higher absolute power and relative beta/delta ratio in the frontal region compared to the GS group. No significant difference was observed between the IWLM and GS groups. No significant difference in the above parameters was observed between the IWHM and IWLM groups. Moreover, The SOD of TST was positively correlated with frontal absolute power and the relative beta/delta ratio (r = 0.363, P = 0.012; r = 0.363, P = 0.012), and absolute beta EEG spectral power (r = 0.313, P = 0.032) as well as the number of arousals.
Conclusions:  Increased frontal beta/delta ratio EEG power was found in young patients with a high mismatch but not in those with a low mismatch, compared with good sleepers. This suggests that there exists increased cortical activity in IWHM patients. In addition, the frontal beta/delta ratio and the number of arousals was positively correlated with the SOD of TST.},

	abstract = {Study Objectives: The diagnosis of insomnia rests on selfreport of difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep. However, subjective reports may be unreliable, and possibly may vary by the method of inquiry. We investigated this possibility by comparing within-individual response to direct versus indirect time queries after overnight polysomnography. Methods: We obtained self-reported sleep-wake times via morning questionnaires in 879 consecutive adult diagnostic polysomnograms. Responses were compared within subjects (direct versus indirect query) and across groups defined by apnea-hypopnea index and by self-reported insomnia symptoms in presleep questionnaires. Direct queries required a time duration response, while indirect queries required clock times from which we calculated time durations. Results: Direct and indirect queries of sleep latency were the same in only 41\% of cases, and total sleep time queries matched in only 5.4\%. For both latency and total sleep, the most common discrepancy involved the indirect value being larger than the direct response. The discrepancy between direct and indirect queries was not related to objective sleep metrics. The degree of discrepancy was not related to the presence of insomnia symptoms, although patients reporting insomnia symptoms showed underestimation of total sleep duration by direct response. Conclusions: Self-reported sleep latency and total sleep time are often internally inconsistent when comparing direct and indirect survey queries of each measure. These discrepancies represent substantive challenges to effective clinical practice, particularly when diagnosis and management depends on self-reported sleep patterns, as with insomnia. Although selfreported sleep-wake times remains fundamental to clinical practice, objective measures provide clinically relevant adjunctive information.},

For the subjective sleep evaluation, we used the Sleep Quality Index—PSQI and for the objective evaluation we used the ActiGraph GT3X+. Among the three analyzed groups, the blind was the only ones who presented differences between subjective and objective sleep duration (p = 0.021). Furthermore, the concordance between subjective and objective sleep duration (ICC = 0.388; p = 0.108) was not observed in blind subjects, and a greater variability of differences in sleep duration between the two methods was observed by the Bland Altman scatter plot. We concluded that the sleep duration obtained by PSQI did not show agreement for the objective sleep duration in blind subjects without light perception.},

	abstract = {Paradoxical Intention (PI) is a cognitive treatment approach for sleep-onset insomnia. It is thought to operate by eliminating voluntary sleep effort, thereby ameliorating sleep performance anxiety, an aroused state incompatible with sleep. However, this remains untested. Moreover, few PI studies have employed objective sleep measures. The present study therefore examined the effect of PI on sleep effort, sleep anxiety and both objective and subjective sleep. Following a seven-night baseline, 34 sleep-onset insomniacs were randomly allocated to 14 nights of PI, or to a control (no PI) condition. Consistent with the performance anxiety model, participants allocated to PI, relative to controls, showed a signiﬁcant reduction in sleep effort, and sleep performance anxiety. Sleep-onset latency (SOL) differences between PI participants and controls using an objective sleep measure were not observed, although an underlying trend for signiﬁcantly lowered subjective SOL amongst PI participants was demonstrated. This may relate to actigraphic insensitivity, or more probably conﬁrms recent suggestions that insomniacs readily overestimate sleep deﬁcit, due to excessive anxiety about sleep. Together, results help determine putative mechanisms underlying PI, have important implications for the clinical application of PI, and emphasize the need for further PI research within an experimental cognitive framework.},

The relationship between sleep efficiency estimated via activity monitors and self-perceived sleep quality on a 1–5 (r = 0.22) and 1–10 Likert scale (r = 0.28) was limited. The outcomes of this investigation support the use of subjective measures to monitor sleep duration in rugby league athletes when objective means are unavailable.

	abstract = {Objective: This study evaluated the agreement between a sleep diary and actigraphy on the assessment of sleep parameters among school teachers from Brazil.
Methods: A total of 163 teachers (66.3\% women; aged 45 ± 9 years) ﬁlled out a sleep diary and wore a wrist actigraph device for seven consecutive days. Data were collected from August 2014 to March 2015 in Londrina, a large city in southern Brazil. Intraclass correlation coefﬁcients (ICC) and Pearson correlation coefﬁcients (r) were used to compare self-reported and actigraphic data.
Results: Self-reported total sleep time (TST), sleep onset latency (SOL), and sleep efﬁciency were higher than measured by actigraphy (mean difference: 22.6 ± 46.9 min, 2.6 ± 13.3 min, and 7.3± 5.7\%, respectively). Subjective total time in bed (TIB) and wake-up time were lower than measured by actigraphy (mean difference: À10.7 ± 37.6 and À19.7 ± 29.6, respectively). Moderate or good agreement and correlation were found between the sleep diary and the actigraphic data for TST (ICC ¼ 0.70; r ¼ 0.60), TIB (ICC ¼ 0.83; r ¼ 0.73), bedtime (ICC ¼ 0.95; r ¼ 0.91), sleep start time (ICC ¼ 0.94; r ¼ 0.88), and wake-up time (ICC ¼ 0.87; r ¼ 0.78). However, SOL (ICC ¼ 0.49; r ¼ 0.38) and sleep efﬁciency (ICC ¼ 0.16; r ¼ 0.22) showed only fair or poor agreement and correlation.
Conclusion: In this highly educated population, the sleep diary and the actigraphy showed moderate or good agreement to assess several sleep parameters. However, these methods seemed to measure different dimensions of sleep regarding sleep onset latency and efﬁciency. These ﬁndings moderately varied according to the individual's subjective sleep quality.},

	abstract = {Methods: In this cross-sectional, observational study, 249 patients with insomnia underwent a videopolysomnography with a subsequent morning interview to assess self-reported sleep estimates and filled in a large battery of questionnaires. Patients were classified into High Misperception (HM) and Moderate Misper­ ception (MM) groups, according to the complement of the ratio between self-reported total sleep time and objective total sleep time (Misperception Index).
Results: No significant differences emerged in any of the psychopathological measures considered between the HM and the MM group. Similarly, no effect was observed in quantitative estimation abilities. HM patients dis­ played a significantly increased number of awakenings per hour of sleep and a reduced dream recall rate. Their overall sleep quality and quality of life was significantly impaired.
Conclusions: Future research on sleep misperception should focus on factors other than the level of psychopa­ thology and estimation abilities, in particular sleep microstructure and quantitative EEG studies in both REM and NREM sleep.},

	abstract = {Objective: Insomnia is commonly co-morbid with obstructive sleep apnea. Among patients reporting insomnia symptoms, sleep misperception occurs when self-reported sleep duration under-estimates objective measures. Misperception represents a clinical challenge since insomnia management is based entirely on patient selfreport. We tested the hypothesis that misperception occurring in sleep apnea patients would improve with subsequent treatment.
Methods: We compared subjective sleep–wake reports with objective sleep in adults with obstructive sleep apnea (n = 405) in two nights of polysomnography (diagnostic and treatment) within a median interval of 92 days.
Results: Sleep latency was generally over-estimated, while wake after sleep onset and number of awakenings were under-estimated. None of these estimations differed between diagnostic and treatment polysomnograms. We observed a large spectrum of total sleep time misperception values during the diagnostic polysomnogram, with one third of the cohort under-estimating their total sleep time by at least 60 min. Of those with N60 minute misperception, we observed improved total sleep time perception during treatment polysomnography. Improved perception correlated with improvements in self-reported sleep quality and response conﬁdence. We found no polysomnogram or demographic predictors of total sleep time misperception for the diagnostic polysomnogram, nor did we ﬁnd objective correlates of improved perception during titration.
Conclusion: Our results suggest that misperception may improve with treatment of obstructive sleep apnea in patients who also exhibit misperception. Within subject changes in misperception are consistent with misperception being, at least to some extent, a state characteristic, which has implications for management of patients with comorbid insomnia and sleep apnea.},

	abstract = {The latency to sleep onset has been reported to be overestimated by chronic insomniacs. Observing that some patients evaluated for suspected hypersomnolence complain of insomnia and others fail to report that they are sleepy, we wondered whether overestimation of sleep latency could be occurring in these subjects as well. Since polysomnography (PSG) only provides one sleep onset with which to assess a patient's estimation, we investigated the use of the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) for this purpose. Among 147 patients who had an MSLT, 137 of whom had a preceding PSG, overestimation of sleep latency occurred on 78\% and 74\% of the respective tests. The magnitude of overestimation averaged 3 minutes and 27 minutes, respectively, and was not dependent on diagnosis. Subjects who had reported a history of difficulty falling asleep, compared to those who did not, tended to show equivalent objective sleep latencies, longer subjective nocturnal sleep latencies and less overall accuracy in their estimates. Those who denied having a problem with excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) showed objective sleep latencies nearly identical to those who complained of EDS but had only a trend toward higher overestimation on the MSLT. Overestimation of sleep latency is therefore more readily part of an explanation for why hypersomnolent patients sometimes complain of insomnia than it is for failure to recognize EDS. The MSLT as well as nocturnal recordings can provide data with which to assess overestimation of sleep latency.

	abstract = {Objective/Background: Subjective methods are often employed for sleep assessment due to their ease of use, but the results may not concur with objective findings. This discrepancy may be present in schizophrenia; however, limited data are available. We performed a secondary analysis to evaluate the agreement between 1-week actigraphy and sleep diaryderived parameters and factors that contribute to subjective-objective sleep discrepancy. Participants: 66 outpatients with schizophrenia (mean age = 44.08 years; 45.45\% males).
Methods: Agreement between subjective-objective parameters was assessed using two-way repeated measures ANOVA, Pearson’s correlation, and Bland-Altman plot. The magnitude of discrepancy was quantified using Cohen’s d. Pearson’s correlation was used to determine the significant factors of subjective-objective sleep discrepancy. Benjamini-Hochberg adjustment was performed to account for multiple testing.
Results: On average, sleep diaries overestimated sleep onset latency by 20.45 min, total sleep time by 37.63 min, and sleep efficiency by 4.29\%, but underestimated wake after sleep onset by 33.28 min. Cohen’s d ranged between 0.61 and 1.41. Subjective-objective discrepancies were significantly associated with marital and employment status, self-reported sleep disturbance, delayed sleep-wake phase disorder, chronotype, and psychosocial functioning (r = 0.32–0.44; Benjamini-Hochberg corrected p {\textless} .05).
Conclusions: Our findings show that differences between subjective and objective measurements of sleep are present in schizophrenia. Although actigraphy is not a standard procedure for sleep disturbance in schizophrenia, clinical judgment should be used if patients are suspected to have overestimated their sleep difficulties. Further studies should examine whether feedback based on actigraphy can benefit patients with schizophrenia and comorbid sleep disturbances.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To compare objective and subjective measurements of napping and to examine the relationship between evening napping and nocturnal sleep in older adults. DESIGN: For 12 days, participants wore actigraphs and completed sleep diaries. SETTING: Community. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred individuals who napped, aged 60 to 89 (including good and poor sleepers with typical age-related medical comorbidities).
MEASUREMENTS: Twelve days of sleep diary and actigraphy provided subjective and objective napping and sleep data.
RESULTS: Evening naps (within 2 hours of bedtime) were characteristic of the sample, with peak nap time occurring between 20:30 and 21:00 (average nap time occurred between 14:30 and 15:00). Two categories of nappers were identiﬁed: those who took daytime and evening naps and daytime-only. No participants napped during the evening only. Day-and-evening nappers signiﬁcantly underreported evening napping and demonstrated lower objectively measured sleep onset latencies (20.0 vs 26.5 minutes), less wake after sleep onset (51.4 vs 72.8 minutes), and higher sleep efﬁciencies (76.8 vs 82\%) than daytime-only nappers.
CONCLUSION: Day and evening napping was prevalent in this sample of community-dwelling good and poor sleepers but was not associated with impaired nocturnal sleep. Although the elimination or restriction of napping is a common element of cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia, these results suggest that a uniform recommendation to restrict or eliminate napping (particularly evening napping) may not meet the needs of all older individuals with insomnia.

	abstract = {Background: To date, clinical pain research has typically used subjective questionnaires to assess effectiveness of treatment. However, in the near future, new technologies may provide us objective outcome measures as an alternative to self-report. The goal of this study is to compare subjective and objective sleep assessments in a population of failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS) patients, treated with spinal cord stimulation (SCS).
Methods: Twenty-two patients diagnosed with FBSS received SCS. Sleep data was collected at three time point: prior to SCS implantation (B), one month after SCS (T1), and two months after SCS (T2). Sleep data measured by actigraphy provided objective sleep data and were compared to Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) scores. Agreement between sleep parameters, total sleep time (TST), sleep efﬁciency (SE), and sleep onset latency (SOL), was examined.
Results: Nineteen out of 22 patients completed the study. We identiﬁed signiﬁcant differences between objective and subjective measurements for TST and SE at baseline and after two months of SCS, with patients underestimating both parameters on the PSQI in comparison to objective measurements. For SOL no signiﬁcant differences were found, although patients subjectively overestimated SOL at B.
Conclusion: The results about sleep measurements shown in this population of chronic pain patients, suggest that the subjective ratings scored worse than the objective measurements. Second, short-term SCS mainly seems to affect subjectively measured sleep parameters, especially SOL. This study shows the discrepancies between objective and subjective assessments in chronic pain research. Objective tools are indispensable for a correct assessment and treatment of sleep parameters. They are also playing a role as a biofeedback tool and are supporting the rehabilitation process.},

Methods This study employed mixed methods (quantitative and qualitative) in a longitudinal design to study adults (n = 26) from ambulatory thoracic clinics. Valid and reliable surveys (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Epworth Sleepiness Scale), 7-day sleep diary, and actigraphy were obtained with interview narrative interpretations of sleep experiences in the context of lung cancer. Data collection occurred at four-time points: baseline (before chemotherapy), pre-second chemotherapy, pre-third chemotherapy, and 6 months from baseline. Sleep measures were compared to interpretations from interview narratives to understand context of survey measures.
Results Objective quantitative results were congruent with interview narrative interpretations that reflected participants’ sleepwake experiences. Objective sleep-wake measures for insomnia over-time described increasing sleep latency and decreasing sleep duration. The interview narratives provided context and insight into participants’ subjective insomnia experiences. While participants’ insomnia symptoms were present, they were resigned to endure insomnia, and the subjective measures reflected a more positive perception of sleep outcomes.
Conclusion A mixed methods approach provides a deeper understanding of sleep-wake disturbances and the differing quantitative objective and subjective results of sleep measures in the context of the participants’ experience of the trajectory of insomnia symptoms before, during, and after lung cancer treatment.},

Consistent with previous studies, our subjects, as a group, produced sleep estimates that were significantly (p {\textless} 0.0001) lower than polysomnographically determined sleep times. However, patients' sleep time perceptions were widely distributed across a broad continuum, which ranged between gross underestimates and remarkable overestimates ofactual sleep times. Results also showed that subgroups, formed on the basis of presenting complaints and diagnostic criteria (i.e. International Classification ofSleep Disorders nosology), differed in regard to the magnitude and direction of their sleep distortions. Moreover, these differences appeared consistent with the types of objective sleep disturbances these subgroups commonly experience. Hence, the tendency to underestimate actual sleep time is not a generic attribute of all insomniacs. Furthermore, it appears that the accuracy and nature of sleep time perceptions may relate to the type of sleep pathology underlying insomniacs' presenting complaints.

To date there are a limited number of studies that compare subjective and objective measures of sleep in populations of subjects with mood disorders. This study evaluated the relationship between subjective and objective measurements of total sleep time (TST) in a bipolar type I disorder (BD I) population.
Methods: Thirty-nine subjects diagnosed with BD I participated in the study. Mood symptoms were assessed via YMRS and IDS-30-C. Subjects wore an actigraph device and maintained a sleep diary for seven consecutive days. Differences between TST as estimated via sleep diaries and actigraphy were calculated.
Results: Objective and subjective measures of TST were signiﬁcantly correlated (r ¼ 0.5151, p ¼0.0008). Secondary analysis revealed that the severity of depressive symptoms did correlate to this discrepancy (t ¼ 2.65, p¼ 0.01). Limitations: The impact that medications have on the accuracy of TST reported was not investigated. Also, sleep diaries may have acted to prompt subjects to pay closer attention to their sleep habits and therefore more accurately report TST than in the average clinical setting.
Conclusion: The results of the current study demonstrate a signiﬁcant correlation between the estimation of TST as measured objectively via actigraphy and subjectively via sleep diaries in BD patients. Mood symptomotology might impact the accuracy of TST reported. Further study is warranted.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To compare subjective sleep evaluation obtained using four questionnaires with polysomnography results for individuals with and without obstructive sleep apnea.
METHODS: Observational and analytical study in which individuals underwent polysomnography were studied retrospectively to investigate sleep disorders. We compared subjective data from a research database used to predict obstructive sleep apnea based on the STOP-BANG questionnaire, evaluation of excessive daytime sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale), sleep quality questionnaire (Mini Sleep Questionnaire) and Post-Sleep Data Collection Instrument with the self-reported total sleep time and sleep-onset latency for subjects with and without obstructive sleep apnea.
RESULTS: The STOP-BANG questionnaire was a good predictor for the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea. However, the other instruments did not show a signiﬁcant difference between healthy and sick individuals. Patients’ perceptions of their sleep onset time were signiﬁcantly lower than the polysomnographic data, but this difference remained for both subjects with and without obstructive sleep apnea. No difference was found between the subjective duration of sleep and the total sleep time assessed by polysomnography in either the healthy subjects or the patients.
CONCLUSION: Except for the STOP-BANG questionnaire, subjective evaluation of sleepiness, sleep quality, perception of onset, and total sleep time are not important parameters for the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea, which reinforces the need for an active search for better management of these patients.},

Methods: The effects of total sleep deprivation (TD) and selective rapid eye movement (REM) sleep deprivation (RD) on sleep perception were analyzed in normal volunteers. Thirty-one healthy males with normal sleep were randomized to one of three conditions: (i) normal uninterrupted sleep; (ii) four nights of RD; or (iii) two nights of TD. Morning perception of total sleep time was evaluated for each condition. Sleep perception was estimated using total sleep time (in hours) as perceived by the volunteer divided by the total sleep time (in hours) measured by polysomnography (PSG). The ﬁnal value of this calculation was deﬁned as the perception index (PI).
Results: There were no signiﬁcant differences among the three groups of volunteers in the total sleep time measured by PSG or in the perception of total sleep time at baseline condition. Volunteers submitted to RD exhibited lower sleep PI scores as compared with controls during the sleep deprivation period (P {\textless} 0.05). Both RD and TD groups showed PI similar to controls during the recovery period.
Conclusion: Selective REM sleep deprivation reduced the ability of healthy young volunteers to perceive their total sleep time when compared with time measured by PSG. The data reinforce the inﬂuence of sleep deprivation on sleep perception.},

This study assessed sleep in 60 prostate cancer patients taking androgen deprivation therapy with wrist actigraphy and daily diaries for 7 days. The Epworth Sleepiness Scale and the general version of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy scale were also administered. On average, total sleep time was 5.9 (SD = 1.4) h, and sleep efﬁciency was 75\% (SD = 12.0) as assessed by actigraphy. There was generally poor concordance between actigraphy and daily diary for most sleep metrics. Subjects reported awakening, on average, 2.7 times per night, most commonly for nocturia and hot ﬂashes. Assessment of daily functioning showed that participants had mild daytime sleepiness, which was predicted by total sleep time (F(1,47) = 4.5, P = 0.04) General quality of life was not impaired.

	abstract = {Methods: Data analysis was based on secondary analysis of standard in-lab polysomnographic recordings in 20 elderly people with insomnia and 21 elderly good sleepers. Parameters indicating sleep fragmentation, such as number of awakenings, wake after sleep onset (WASO) and percentage of NREM1 were extracted from the polsysomnogram, as well as spectral power, microarousals and sleep spindle index. The correlation between these parameters during the ﬁrst sleep cycle and the amount of misperceived sleep was assessed in the insomnia group. Additionally, we made a model of the minimum duration that a sleep fragment at sleep onset should have in order to be perceived as sleep, and we ﬁtted this model to subjective SOLs of both subject groups.
Results: Misperception of SOL was associated with increased percentage of NREM1 and more WASO during sleep cycle 1. For insomnia subjects, the best ﬁt of modelled SOL with subjective SOL was found when assuming that sleep fragments shorter than 30 min at sleep onset were perceived as wake. The model indicated that healthy subjects are less sensitive to sleep interruptions and perceive fragments of 10 min or longer as sleep.
Conclusions: Our ﬁndings suggest that sleep onset misperception is related to sleep fragmentation at the beginning of the night. Moreover, we show that people with insomnia needed a longer duration of continuous sleep for the perception as such compared to controls. Further expanding the model could provide more detailed information about the underlying mechanisms of sleep misperception.},

	abstract = {Objectives The aim of this study is to explore potential mechanisms of sleep fragmentation influencing alterations of perceived sleep quality.
Methods We analyzed polysomnography (PSG) recordings from a double-blind crossover study with zopiclone 7.5 mg and placebo, in elderly participants with insomnia complaints and age-matched healthy controls. We compared survival dynamics of sleep and wake across group and treatment. Subsequently, we used a previously proposed model to estimate the amount of sleep onset latency (SOL) misperception from PSG-defined sleep fragmentation. Self-reported and model-estimated amount of SOL misperception were compared across group and treatment, as well as model prediction errors.
Results In the zopiclone night, the average segment length of NREM sleep was increased (group F = 1.16, p = 0.32; treatment F = 8.89, p {\textless} 0.01; group x treatment F = 0.44, p = 0.65), while the segment length of wake was decreased (group F = 1.48, p = 0.23; treatment F = 11.49, p {\textless} 0.01; group x treatment F = 0.36, p = 0.70). The self-reported and model-estimated amount of SOL misperception were lower during the zopiclone night (self-reported group F = 6.08, p {\textless} 0.01, treatment F = 10.8, p {\textless} 0.01, group x treatment F = 2.49, p = 0.09; model-estimated F = 1.70, p = 0.19, treatment F = 16.1, p {\textless} 0.001, group x treatment F = 0.60, p = 0.55). The prediction error was not altered (group F = 1.62, p = 0.20; treatment F = 0.20, p = 0.65; group x treatment F = 1.01, p = 0.37).
Conclusions Impaired subjective sleep quality is associated with decreased NREM stability, together with increased stability of wake. Furthermore, we conclude that zopiclone-induced changes in SOL misperception can be largely attributed to predictable changes of sleep architecture.},

We collected overnight sleep data via polysomnography (PSG), subjective sleep data via a morning questionnaire (self-evaluated) and MSLT data via four 20-min naps over 8 h. Subjects included 122 PIPs and 48 GSCs. Sleep perception was calculated as subjective sleep time ⁄ objective sleep time · 100\%. PIPs showed a signiﬁcant difference (P {\textless} 0.001) between sleep time, as determined by PSG (387.8 ± 100 min) and self-report (226.3 ± 160 min), but no difference was obtained for GSCs (440.6 ± 53 versus 435.4 ± 65 min). The means for sleep perception were 56.4 ± 38.8\% for the PIPs and 99.3 ± 13.6\% for the GSCs (P {\textless} 0.001). In the PIPs group, weak but statistically signiﬁcant negative correlations (r: )0.20 to )0.25) were found for MSLT versus sleep perception and versus self- and PSG-evaluated sleep time. Compared to PIPs with low scores on the MSLT, those with high scores had less sleep perception (\%), less self- and PSG-evaluated sleep time and greater sleep misperception time. GSCs did not show signiﬁcant correlations between MSLT and sleep measures or differences in comparisons between individuals with high and low scores on the MSLT. These results add novel data to the literature by suggesting that 24-h hyperarousal potentially plays a key role in the pathophysiological issues of insomnia.},

Self-report may be subject to recall bias based upon current mood/ affect states. This study sought to identify the degree of inaccuracy between subjective and objective measures of sleep duration in those with and without BD, and to assess the demographic and clinical correlates of this inaccuracy.
Methods: Thirty-one individuals with BD and 54 healthy control (HC) participants reported on the number of hours slept a night over the past month and subsequently completed up to 14 days/nights of wrist actigraphy which provided an objective measure of sleep duration. We compared the subjective rating to the average of all nights of objective sleep duration, and correlated the magnitude of inaccuracy with demographic and clinical characteristics in the BD and HC groups.
Results: On average, both BD and HC groups overestimated their sleep, and there were no differences in inaccuracy between groups. In the BD group, greater inaccuracy was associated with lower functioning, even after controlling individually for objective and subjective sleep measures. Limitations: Cross-sectional study, only focus on sleep duration, and less severe bipolar symptoms of sample.
Conclusions: Inaccuracy in reports of sleep duration was associated with lower functioning among BD patients. Better identifying discrepancies in reports of sleep duration in clinical practice could help in more efficient monitoring and management of BD symptoms.},

Methods Sleep characteristics of 54 breast cancer patients starting neoadjuvant chemotherapy were analyzed. Subjective sleep characteristics were assessed with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and objective sleep measurements with an accelerometer (ActiGraph wGT3X-BT) worn on the wrist for 7 consecutive days.
Results According to the common PSQI cut-off of 8, 10 (18.87\%) of the patients were poor sleepers. ActiGraph measures did not mirror this classification as values for poor, and good sleepers did not differ significantly. Overall, Bland-Altman plots illustrated higher ActiGraph values for sleep efficiency and effective sleep time and lower values for sleep latency, compared with PSQI. For total sleep time, less disagreement between both measures was observed. Actigraphy was limited in precise identification of sleep begin and sleep latency but provided supplementary information about number and minutes of awakenings during the night.
Conclusion Subjective and objective measurement methods differed substantially in various parameters, with limitations in both methods. A combination of both methods might be most promising. Trial Registration Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT02999074},

	abstract = {Background: Bipolar disorder (BD) is associated with sleep misperception. The objective of this study was to investigate the correlation between subjective and objective measures of sleep in persons with symptomatic bipolar disorder (BDS) compared to healthy controls (HC).
Methods: We studied 24 BDS and 30 HC subjects similar in age, race and sex. Subjective sleep was measured with Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and objective sleep with 7-days of actigraphy. Absolute discrepancy variables were calculated by subtracting objective sleep latency (SL) and total sleep time (TST) on actigraphy from their respective subjective estimates from PSQI. Mood symptoms were measured with Young Mania Rating Scale and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale.
Results: In the BDS group, subjective TST did not signiﬁcantly correlate with objective TST, while it correlated in the HC group. The BDS group had signiﬁcantly higher absolute discrepancy between subjective and objective SL and TST compared to the HC group. Multivariable regression analysis showed that severity of depression was associated with greater absolute discrepancy between subjective and objective TST within the BDS group. Limitations: Subjects are from a tertiary care center and were on medications for treatment of BD symptoms.
Conclusion: There is low correlation between subjective and objective TST in BDS subjects and more severe depressive symptoms are associated with greater absolute discrepancy in TST. Objective rather than subjective measures of sleep, such as actigraphy, may be needed to evaluate sleep in BD subjects. Cognitive-behavioral interventions to address sleep misperception and associated depressed mood may be indicated in BD.},

Design: Patients with PI were randomly assigned to CBT or a placebo intervention (PC). Ambulatory polysomnography was performed before and after treatment. Setting: University medical center sleep laboratory. Participants: Thirty PI patients with sleep maintenance difficulty evident in subjective sleep measures. Interventions: CBT and PC. Results: CBT led to a more rapid decline in EEG delta power over the night, compared with PC. This change was associated with subjective improvement in response to CBT. Furthermore, lower pretreatment peak EEG delta power in the first NREM cycle and a more gradual decline in delta power predicted a better response to CBT. Increased wake time during the day produced by CBT was correlated with an increase in the steepness of the slope of EEG delta power and subjective improvement. Traditional polysomnography measures were associated with the subjective CBT response to a greater degree among patients whose total sleep time estimates better approximated polysomnography-derived total sleep time. In contrast, changes in all-night averaged NREM EEG spectral indices were more strongly related to subjective improvement in individuals who underestimated total sleep time to a greater extent. Conclusions: CBT led to a more rapid decline in EEG delta power over the night. This change is linked to the therapeutic effect of CBT, which appears to occur in conjunction with an increase in homeostatic sleep drive. Traditional polysomnography indices and all-night averaged NREM EEG measures appear to be related to subjective improvements with CBT in subsets of patients with PI.},

The extent to which self reports of sleep duration are similar to objective measures and whether individual characteristics inﬂuence the degree of similarity are not known.
Methods: Eligible participants at the Chicago site of the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study were invited to participate in a 2003–2005 ancillary sleep study; 82\% (n ϭ 669) agreed. Sleep measurements collected in 2 waves included 3 days each of wrist actigraphy, a sleep log, and questions about usual sleep duration. We estimate the average difference and correlation between subjectively and objectively measured sleep by using errorsin-variables regression models.
Results: Average measured sleep was 6 hours, whereas the average from subjective reports was 6.8 hours. Subjective reports increased on average by 34 minutes for each additional hour of measured sleep. Overall, the correlation between reported and measured sleep duration was 0.47. Our model suggests that persons sleeping 5 hours over-reported their sleep duration by 1.2 hours, and those sleeping 7 hours over-reported by 0.4 hours. The correlations and average differences between self-reports and measured sleep varied by health, sociodemographic, and sleep characteristics.
Conclusion: In a population-based sample of middle-aged adults, subjective reports of habitual sleep are moderately correlated with actigraph-measured sleep, but are biased by systematic over-reporting. The true associations between sleep duration and health may},

	abstract = {Purpose  To examine self-reported (30-day) sleep versus nightly actigraphy-assessed sleep concordance in long-term survivors of childhood cancer.
Methods  Four hundred seventy-seven participants enrolled in the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort (53.5\% female, median (range) age 34.3 (19.3–61.6) years, 25.4 (10.9–49.3) years from diagnosis) completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and ≥ 3 nights of actigraphy. Participants had neurocognitive impairment and/or a self-reported prolonged sleep onset latency (SOL). Self-reported 30-day sleep and nightly actigraphic sleep measures for sleep duration, SOL, and sleep efficiency (SE) were converted into ordinal categories for calculation of weighted kappa coefficients. General linear models estimated associations between measurement concordance and late effects.
Results  Agreements between self-reported and actigraphic measures were slight to fair for sleep duration and SOL measures (kw = 0.20 and kw = 0.22, respectively; p {\textless} 0.0001) and poor for SE measures (kw = 0.00, p = 0.79). In multivariable models, severe fatigue and poor sleep quality were significantly associated with greater absolute differences between self-reported and actigraphy-assessed sleep durations (B = 26.6 [p {\textless} 0.001] and B = 26.8 [p = 0.01], respectively). Survivors with (versus without) memory impairment had a 44-min higher absolute difference in sleep duration (B = 44.4, p {\textless} 0.001). Survivors with, versus without, depression and poor sleep quality had higher absolute discrepancies of SOL (B = 24.5 [p = 0.01] and B = 16.4 [p {\textless} 0.0001], respectively). Poor sleep quality was associated with a 12\% higher absolute difference in SE (B = 12.32, p {\textless} 0.0001).
Conclusions  Self-reported sleep and actigraphic sleep demonstrated discordance in our sample. Several prevalent late effects were statistically significantly associated with increased measurement discrepancy. Future studies should consider the impacts of late effects on sleep assessment in adult survivors of childhood cancer.},

	abstract = {Objective: We investigated the association of alpha–delta sleep (A–DS) with: (1) perception of light sleep and (2) discrepancy between subjective and objective sleep duration.
Methods: We analyzed data from 5764 individuals who underwent polysomnography (PSG) and replied questions about quantity and quality of sleep, including sleep depth. The difference between objectively recorded sleep time and subjectively estimated sleep time was calculated. Alpha–delta sleep (A–DS) was visually scored in a scale from 1 to 4, based on the density and overnight duration of alpha activity and conﬁrmed using spectral array of the electroencephalographic activity.
Results: A–DS scores 1–4 occurred in, respectively, 37.9\%; 31.3\%; 20.5\%; and 6.2\% of the cases. ANOVA showed signiﬁcant difference of light sleep sensation (p {\textless} 0.001) and sleep time underestimation (p {\textless} 0.001) among the four A–DS categories. Regression to explain both light sleep and sleep time underestimation, controlling for confounders, conﬁrmed A–DS as a signiﬁcant regressor.
Conclusions: This study of a large prospective sample provides evidence for the association of alpha–delta sleep with subjective sensation of light sleep and with sleep time underestimation. Signiﬁcance: Alpha–delta sleep may be a marker of the physiological disorder underlying light sleep and sleep state misperception.

Whether a similar phenomenon occurs with other sleep disorders is not fully established. We compared the PSG sleep of 84 patients with suspected sleep apnea (SA) to their subjective experience ofsleep reported on a sleep diary the morning after PSG testing. Both patients with SA (SA + ) and those without (SA -) tended to overestimate SOL, but the SA+ group (n = 50) made larger overestimations (p {\textless} 0.02). The SA+ and SA-groups also differed in their accuracy at estimating TST, with SA + patients underestimating TST (p {\textless} 0.05).

Whether this perception can be expressed, in a standardized questionnaire as the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), has to our knowledge never been documented in CFS. Furthermore, correlations of subjective fatigue, PSQI, affective symptoms and objective parameters such as sleep efficiency are poorly described in the literature. \textit{Methods:} Using a cross-sectional paradigm, we studied subjective measures like PSQI, Fatigue Severity Scale scores and intensity of affective symptoms rated by the Hamilton Depression and Anxiety scales as well as objective sleep quality parameters measured by polysomnography of 28 ‘pure’ (no primary sleep and no psychiatric disorders) CFS patients compared to age- and gender-matched healthy controls. \textit{Results:} The PSQI showed significantly poorer subjective sleep quality in CFS patients than in healthy controls. In contrast, objective sleep quality parameters, like the Sleep Efficiency Index (SEI) or the amount of slow-wave sleep did not differ significantly. Subjective sleep quality showed a correlation trend with severity of fatigue and was not correlated with the intensity of affective symptoms in CFS. \textit{Conclusion:} Our findings indicate that a sleep quality misperception exists in CFS or that potential nocturnal neurophysiological disturbances involved in the nonrecovering sensation in CFS are not expressed by sleep variables such as the SEI or sleep stage distributions and proportions.},

	abstract = {Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis on patients with or without obstructive sleep apnea during overnight diagnostic polysomnography in our laboratory (n = 391; n = 252). We compared subjective and objective sleep-wake durations to characterize misperception. We introduce a new metric, sleep during subjective latency (SDSL), which captures latency misperception without defining objective sleep latency and allows correction for latency misperception when assessing total sleep time (TST) misperception.
Results: The stage content of SDSL is related to latency misperception, but in the opposite manner as our hypothesis: those with {\textgreater} 20 minutes of SDSL had less N1\%, more N3\%, and lower transition frequency. After adjusting for misperceived sleep during subjective sleep latency, TST misperception was greater in those with longer bouts of REM and N2 stages (OSA patients) as well as N3 (non-OSA patients), which also did not support our hypothesis.
Conclusions: Despite the advantages of SDSL as a phenotyping tool to overcome operational issues with quantifying misperception, our results argue against the hypothesis that light or fragmented sleep underlies misperception. Further investigation of sleep physiology utilizing alternative methods than that captured by conventional stages may yield additional mechanistic insights into misperception.},

Design: Cross-sectional study using data from Wave 3 of The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (2014À2015). Participants: Community-dwelling older adults, aged 50 years, with self-reported sleep information and 4 days of actigraphy-based TST (n = 1520). Measurement: Self-reported total sleep time, daytime sleepiness, insomnia symptoms (trouble falling asleep, trouble waking too early) measured during a structured self-interview. Actigraphy-based total TST was collected using GENEactiv wrist-worn accelerometers. Demographic characteristics and health information were controlled for. Analyses included descriptive statistics, reliability and agreement analysis using paired t-tests, intra-class correlations and Bland-Altman analysis. Linear regression was used to model associations with measurement discrepancies.
Results: Participants reported that they slept 7.0 hours (SD: 1.4, Range: 2.0À13.0 hours) on average, compared to 7.7 hours (SD: 1.2 hours, Range: 3.0À13.0 hours) recorded by accelerometry. Trouble falling asleep or waking too early “most of the time” were associated with under-reporting of sleep by 2.3, and 2.2 hours respectively. Agreement between measurements had an intra-class correlation of 0.18 and wide 95\% limits of agreement (-3.90 to 2.55 hours). Under-reporting of sleep was independently associated with insomnia symptoms.
Conclusion: The agreement between self-reported and actigraphy-based TST in community dwelling older adults was low. Self-reported insomnia symptoms were independently associated with under-reporting of sleep. Studies seeking to measure sleep duration should consider inclusion of questions measuring experience of insomnia symptoms to account for potential inﬂuence on measurements.},

	abstract = {Objectives: Describe sleep duration in adult Sri Lankans and determine the bias and agreement of self-report and actigraphic assessments. Design: Validation sub-study nested within the Colombo Twin and Singleton Study (2012-2015). Setting: Colombo, Sri Lanka. Participants: 175 adults with actigraphy, randomly selected from 3497 participants with self-reported sleep assessed in a population-based cohort.
Measurements: Self-reported sleep duration, ascertained by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), was compared to a minimum of four days of actigraphy. Bias and agreement were assessed using the Bland-Altman method and a novel application of criterion cut-point analysis. Objective measurements of wake after sleep onset (WASO) and sleep efﬁciency were evaluated.
Results: Sri Lankans have short sleep duration; averaging 6.4h (SD 1.5) self-reported and 6.0h (SD 0.9) actigraphically. Poor sleep quality was prevalent with an average WASO of 49 min., and sleep efﬁciency b85\%. Bias was observed, with self-report consistently over-reporting sleep on average by 27.6 min (95\% CI: -0.68, -0.24) compared to objective measures, but wide individual variation in disagreement, ranging from over-reporting by 3.34h to under-reporting by 2.42h. A criterion cut-point method also failed to deﬁne agreed deﬁnitions of short and long sleep duration.
Conclusions: Sleep in Sri Lankan adults, whether measured subjectively or objectively, is of short duration and suboptimal objective quality by High Income Country consensus standards. Given the high cardiometabolic morbidity in Sri Lanka and poor measurement agreement observed, this warrants further investigation and supports the need for culturally appropriate, reliable, and valid assessment for analytic epidemiology in non-Western settings.},

Over a 1-week period, sleep data were collected using sleep actigraphy and self-report. Across the entire sample, subjective and objective assessment methods of sleep were strongly correlated, although there were some notable within-group differences. Speciﬁcally, although sleep duration between groups did not differ based on actigraphy, veterans without PTSD reported sleeping 1 h and 11 min (p ϭ .002) longer than did veterans with PTSD. In an effort to determine why individuals without PTSD might be overreporting sleep, we found that symptoms of emotional arousal (anger, anxiety, and nightmares) were signiﬁcantly correlated with self-reported sleep duration, suggesting a pattern of higher autonomic arousal found in veterans with PTSD. Thus, although sleeping for 6 h, the higher levels of emotional arousal reported by veterans with PTSD may mean that they do not perceive their sleep as restful. Further research is necessary to determine if the sleep architecture of veterans with PTSD is actually different from that of combat veterans without PTSD and if such differences are actually amenable to standard behavioral treatments for this disorder.},

	abstract = {Study Objectives: Two experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of presleep arousal on sleep perception. Experiment 1 examined the link between presleep cognitive arousal and distorted perception of sleep and compared the relative effect of anxious and neutral cognitive arousal on sleep perception. Experiment 2 compared the relative effect of anxious cognitive arousal and physiological arousal on sleep perception. Design: Participants completed a nap session. Just prior to the nap, the participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups to receive different arousal manipulations. They were then allowed to go to sleep and were asked to report their sleep perception upon waking. Setting: Sleep laboratory. Participants: Fifty-four healthy good sleepers in each experiment. Interventions: N/A. Measurements and Results: Self-reported sleep, actigraphy-defined sleep, and the discrepancy between them were indexed. In Experiment 1, participants who were experimentally manipulated to experience anxious cognitive arousal during the presleep period reported longer sleep-onset latency. Both the Anxious Cognitive Arousal Group and the Neutral Cognitive Arousal Group exhibited a greater discrepancy between selfreported and actigraphy-defined sleep, relative to participants who received no manipulation. In Experiment 2, participants who were experimentally manipulated to experience anxious cognitive arousal or physiological arousal during the presleep period reported longer sleep-onset latency and shorter total sleep time, and both groups exhibited a greater discrepancy between the self-reported and actigraphy-defined sleep, relative to participants who received no manipulation. Conclusions: Results suggest that both presleep cognitive arousal and presleep physiological arousal contribute to distorted perception of sleep.},

People denoted as ‘‘morning types’’ (‘‘larks’’) like to rise early in the morning and go to bed early, while ‘‘evening types’’ (‘‘owls’’) prefer to sleep until later in the day and stay up until later at night. Various self-report instruments that measure morningness-eveningness have been developed. The aim of this study was to validate seven different self-report measures on morningness-eveningness using actigraphic data. One hundred and sixty-six students (mean age 21.4 years, range 19–30) were recruited from the University of Bergen and Bergen University College. The participants completed the self-report measures and wore an actigraph for seven days. The results showed that all self-report measures were in concordance with actigraphy-measured bed times, rise times, and the nadir for physical activity. In addition, some of the instruments were sensitive to differences between morning and evening types in their total sleep time on weekend nights or their stability in the activity curve across days as measured by actigraphy. Both the strengths and weaknesses of the present study are discussed, and proposals for future research are presented.},

However, its reliability needs to be evaluated because overlooked chronic sleep insufﬁciency could be misdiagnosed as narcolepsy. In this study, we compared simultaneous sleep measurements using a sleep diary and by actigraphy in patients visiting our sleep clinic for the ﬁrst time with complaints of excessive daytime sleepiness. Of the 28 patients enrolled, 24 complied with both these requirements. In this population, the results obtained using a sleep diary tended to estimate a statistically signiﬁcant earlier sleep onset time and longer total sleep time than those via actigraphy. For total sleep time, this tendency was more prominent in patients with a higher Epworth Sleepiness Scale score. In 5 of the 24 (20.8\%) patients, the sleep diary records indicated {\textgreater}6 h of total sleep time while the actigraphy records indicated {\textless}6 h of total sleep time, with a discrepancy of {\textgreater}1 h. These results suggested that sleep insufﬁciency in hypersomnia patients may be overlooked when their sleep time is assessed using only a sleep diary in the initial phase of the diagnostic procedure, and the simultaneous use of actigraphy may be preferable in this assessment.},

In this study, sleep diaries were compared with actigraphy monitoring to investigate the correspondence between measures of sleep in children and adolescents and provide normative data. Differences in age, gender, and school day/weekend were investigated. Sixty-six (21 boys, 45 girls) children and adolescents (11–17 years) wore a wrist actigraphy monitor and completed a 7-day sleep diary. Measures of sleep onset, wake time, wake after sleep onset, and total sleep time were obtained. Less than recommended (9–11 h) amounts of sleep were obtained throughout the week and all participants underestimated the duration of their night wake. Children went to sleep signiﬁcantly earlier and obtained more sleep than adolescents. Sleep onset and wake time were signiﬁcantly later on weekends than school days for both age groups. No signiﬁcant gender differences were found for any objectively measured sleep parameter. Correlations between diary and actigraphy were moderate to high and signiﬁcant for sleep onset, wake time, and total sleep time. Paired samples t-tests indicated a signiﬁcant difference between diary and actigraphy scores for all variables except children’s sleep onset. Overall, children and adolescents overestimated their total sleep time by approximately an hour, primarily through an under appreciation of night awakenings.},

Linear regression was applied to predict the discrepancy between selfreported and objective sleep parameters (total sleep time, sleep efﬁciency, sleep latency, using age, sex, arousal index, type of sleep disorder, and PSG type [laboratory vs ambulatory] as regressors).
Results: A total of 303 PSGs were analyzed (49\% women, median age 48 years), comprising patients with insomnia (32\%), sleep-related breathing disorders (27\%), sleep-related movement disorders (15\%), hypersomnia/narcolepsy (14\%), and parasomnias (12\%). Sleep disorder was the best predictor of discrepancy between self-reported and objective total sleep time, and patients with insomnia showed higher discrepancy values compared to all other patient groups (P {\textless}.001), independent of age and PSG type (P {\textgreater} .05). Contributory effects for higher discrepancy values were found for lower arousal index. Patients with insomnia underestimated both total sleep time (median discrepancy: 46 minutes, P {\textless}.001) and sleep efﬁciency (median discrepancy: 11\%, P {\textless}.001). No signiﬁcant predictor for discrepancy of sleep latency was found.
Conclusions: Misperception of sleep duration and efﬁciency is common in sleep lab patients, but most prominent in insomnia, independent of age, sex, or laboratory vs ambulatory recording setting. This underlines the role of PSG in patients with a clinical diagnosis of insomnia and its use in cognitive behavioral therapy.},

Conversely, the present study aimed to assess the prevalence and correlates of sleep-wake misperception in a large cohort of patients with various sleep-wake disorders, all diagnosed along the third version of the International Classiﬁcation of Sleep Disorders.
Methods: We retrospectively included 2738 patients examined by polysomnography, who in addition estimated upon awakening their total sleep time, sleep onset latency and Wake after sleep onset (WASO). We computed subjective-objective mismatch by the formula (subjective e objective value)/objective value Â100; negative and positive values indicated under- and overestimation, respectively.
Results: In the entire sample, the magnitude of under- and overestimation of total sleep time was similar, but varied signiﬁcantly between diagnostic groups, with insomnia and insufﬁcient sleep syndrome showing the most pronounced underestimation and REM parasomnia and circadian rhythm disorders showing the most pronounced overestimation of total sleep time. In all diagnostic categories, a majority tended to overestimate their sleep onset latency and to underestimate the amount of WASO. Younger age was independently correlated with underestimation of total sleep time and WASO, and with overestimation of sleep onset latency. Overestimation of sleep onset latency independently correlated to an increased latency to N3 sleep stage on polysomnography.
Conclusions: While sleep-wake misperception is highly prevalent in all sleep-wake disorders, signiﬁcant differences exist in magnitude of under- and overestimation between distinct diagnostic groups. © 2021 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Insomnia is a signiﬁcant problem for many people with chronic pain. In this study, we used a combination of daily sleep diaries and ambulatory activity monitoring (actigraphy) to: (i) examine the nature and severity of the sleep disturbance in this patient group; (ii) determine the concordance between sleep diary and actigraph measures of different sleep parameters; (iii) assess the reliability of sleep parameters across nights; and (iv) identify the clinical correlates of insomnia severity. Forty subjects with insomnia associated with chronic musculoskeletal pain completed questionnaires addressing clinical issues of pain severity, medication use, sleep quality, and affective distress. For 2 consecutive nights, each subject then completed a sleep diary and wore an actigraph unit on the non-dominant wrist. The results showed that the sleep diaries and the actigraphs provided similar estimates of total sleep time, time awake after sleep onset, and sleep efﬁciency, but differed in the measurement of sleep onset latency and nocturnal awakenings. Both methods of assessment exhibited low to moderate reliability across nights. Measures of the same sleep parameters across the two methods of assessment showed low concordance. Of the clinical variables, pain severity had the strongest association with disturbed sleep, but only using the diary method of assessment. Subjects who reported high pain severity also reported greater sleep impairment than subjects with low pain severity, but this was not conﬁrmed by actigraphy. In general, both methods of assessment point to the signiﬁcance of insomnia associated with chronic musculoskeletal pain as a distinct clinical problem, but the activity monitoring and self-report procedures provide different information. These ﬁndings suggest that multi-method assessment is an important consideration for studies of insomnia in patients with chronic pain. © 1998 International Association for the Study of Pain.

Design and Setting: High school students completed a Sleep Habits Survey about the previous 2 weeks and then wore an actigraph (AMI, Ardsley, NY) for 8 days while keeping a daily sleep diary. Matched-pair t tests assessed average differences between survey and diary reports and between survey and actigraph estimates. Pearson correlations assessed the extent to which survey reports were in agreement with diary reports and actigraphy estimates. Participants: 302 high school students (196 girls, 106 boys) in grades 912 from five high schools. Results: School-night survey total sleep times and wake times did not differ from sleep amounts reported in the diary or estimated by actigraphy; survey bedtimes were slightly earlier. On weekends, survey total sleep times and wake times were longer and later, respectively, than estimated with actigraphy and reported on diaries. Moreover, school- and weekendnight survey variables were significantly correlated both with diary and actigraphy variables. Strengths of the associations were consistently greater for school-night variables than the corresponding weekend-night variables.

However, there is no valid and reliable self-report sleep questionnaire for elementary school-aged children. The aim of this study was to examine the availability of a simple self-report sleep questionnaire for 9- to 12-year-old children. Participants were 58 children aged 9–12 years from one elementary school in a rural area of Japan. Participants wore an accelerometer for 10 consecutive days and completed the sleep questionnaire twice. Sleep measures included bedtime, wake time, and assumed and actual sleep duration on weekdays and weekends. The data obtained from the accelerometer and sleep/wake scoring software were used to assess criterion validity. Pearson correlation coefﬁcients and Bland–Altman plots were used to evaluate the relationships between objective and self-reported sleep measures. Test-retest reliability was evaluated using intraclass correlation coefﬁcients. The correlations between the objective and questionnaire measures were moderate to high (r = 0.45 to 0.90) and signiﬁcant, except girls’ wake time, assumed sleep duration, and actual sleep duration on weekends. The Bland–Altman plots indicated that bedtime and wake time obtained from the questionnaire were underestimated for both weekdays and weekends. Test-retest reliability of the questionnaire was high, with intraclass coefﬁcients ranging from 0.71 to 0.99. Although caution should be exercised when evaluating sleep duration on weekends, this simple self-reported sleep questionnaire is a useful tool for assessing sleep habits in 9- to 12-yearold children, particularly in school-based and large-scale epidemiological studies.},

Methods: We performed a secondary analysis of three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of acupuncture for primary insomnia and residual insomnia associated with major depression. A total of 86 participants were randomized to receive placebo acupuncture three times per week for three consecutive weeks. Outcome was assessed at 1-week posttreatment. Response was deﬁned as an Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) score improved by eight points or more from baseline to 1-week posttreatment. Sociodemographic, clinical, and baseline characteristics including sleep diary-derived and actigraphderived sleep parameters as predictors of placebo response were examined using univariate and multivariate logistic regression.
Results: The effect size of placebo acupuncture was estimated at 0.18 for total sleep time, 0.08 for sleep eﬃciency, and 0.92 for ISI score. Eighteen (20.9\%) of the 86 participants were responders. Responders had a higher ISI score (p = 0.03), higher sleep diary–derived total sleep time (p = 0.02), less discrepancy between sleep diary–derived and actigraph-derived total sleep time (p = 0.03), and higher expectation toward acupuncture (p = 0.03) at baseline compared to nonresponders. Multivariate regression analysis found that only ISI score remained signiﬁcant (odds ratio = 1.23, 95\% conﬁdence interval = 1.02–1.50, p = 0.03).
Conclusions: Baseline sleep parameters and perceived effectiveness were shown to predict the placebo response of acupuncture for insomnia. Although the study was limited by a small sample size, our ﬁndings highlighted the potential implication of sleep duration and sleep-state misperception in the treatment of insomnia.},

	abstract = {Objective: To assess the agreement of sleep parameters measured by two actigraphs (SOMNOwatch plus®, ActiGraph GT3X+®) at two different placements (wrist, hip) and of self-reported sleep with polysomnography (PSG).
Methods: We estimated agreement with PSG for total sleep time (TST), sleep onset latency (SOL), wake after sleep onset (WASO), number of awakenings after sleep onset (NASO), and sleep eﬃciency (SE\%) for 100 participants of the general population, aged 18–75 years by judging mean differences to PSG and intervals of agreement using Bland–Altman plots.
Results: Mean difference to PSG for TST was 8.3 min (95\% conﬁdence intervals [CI] −7.4; 24.1) for SOMNOwatch plus® (wrist), 39.8 min (95\% CI 24.3; 55.3) for self-report, −79.0 min (95\% CI −89.0; −68.9) for SOMNOwatch plus® (hip), and −81.1 min (95\% CI −91.9; −70.4) for GT3X+® (hip), respectively. The width of intervals of agreement differed with the placement of the devices. Mean differences to PSG were higher for hip-based measurements compared with wrist placement for most parameters.
Conclusions: Agreement of sleep parameters assessed by actigraphy with PSG differs with the placement of the device and is limited for hip-based measurements. Agreement of self-report with PSG is comparable to that of actigraphy for some parameters.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2020.103719},
	abstract = {Background: Given the harmful effects of night shifts and rotating schedules on nurses’ sleep and work performance, shift nurses’ sleep patterns have been a research concern. Actigraphy involves acquisition of data using a movement sensor worn continuously on the nondominant wrist, typically for a week or more. Although actigraphy provides objective and accurate sleep data, sleep diaries have been a practical alternative. However, there is a lack of research on the agreement and consistency between the two methods of measuring sleep for shift work nurses. In addition, differences in sleep patterns by shift types among 8-hour fast-rotating shift work nurses has not yet been examined.
Objectives: To evaluate the agreement between the sleep diary and actigraphy methods for sleep assessment, and to compare sleep parameters of 8-hour fast-rotating shift work nurses according to shift type. Design: Descriptive and prospective study design. Settings: Two tertiary hospitals in Seoul, South Korea. Participants: A total of 94 shift work nurses who wore actigraphy along with completing a sleep diary.
Methods: Subjective and objective sleep parameters were recorded during a two-week period in a sleep diary and actigraphy, respectively. Bland-Altman plots and intraclass correlation coeﬃcients were used to analyze the agreement between the two methods. Sleep parameters according to shift type were compared using the Kruskal–Wallis and Mann–Whitney U tests.
Results: Good agreement was observed between the sleep diary and the actigraphy data for total sleep time (intraclass correlation coeﬃcients = 0.765 or 0.858) and variability in sleep time (intraclass correlation coeﬃcients = 0.838). When compared to the actigraphy data, diary-derived data were overestimated by 41–45 min for total sleep time and 0.4\% for variability in sleep time. There was a difference of 2–3 h of sleep quantity by shift type: 5.3–5.8 h for day shifts and 7.1–8.4 h for night shifts.
Conclusions: A sleep diary can function as an acceptable alternative to actigraphy for measuring shift work nurses’ sleep patterns, speciﬁcally total sleep time and variability in sleep time. Given the high variability in sleep among shift work nurses, both personal and organizational efforts are required. Nurses should monitor their sleep quantity and develop their own regular sleep schedules to ﬁt their work schedules. Hospitals should establish healthy schedules for nurses to guarantee suﬃcient sleep hours before work. Future research on shift work nurses’ sleep should examine ﬂuctuations in sleep duration.},

	abstract = {Objectives: The negative effects of osteoarthritis (OA), such as pain and depression, interfere with an individual’s sleep quality. The main objective of the present study was to investigate the prevalence of poor quality of sleep in individuals with OA in Taiwan and identify potential predictors. A secondary objective was to examine agreement between objective and subjective measures of sleep quality.
Methods: In a cross-sectional survey, OA outpatients in Taiwan completed a self-administered questionnaire, incorporating validated measurements for assessing quality of sleep (the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)), pain and physical functioning, anxiety and depression, and health-related quality of life. In a nested feasibility study, a sub-sample of participants wore an Actigraph wrist monitor to measure sleep objectively over a three-day period.
Results: Of 192 individuals with OA who completed the survey, 30 completed the Actigraph study. The mean PSQI global score was 9.0 (standard deviation 4.5); most participants (135, 70.3\%) had poor quality of sleep (global PSQI {\textgreater}5). Key predictors of poor quality of sleep included role limitation due to poor physical functioning, poor social functioning, higher anxiety levels and higher pain levels. There were moderate correlations between subjective and objective measures of sleep quality, although participants underestimated their true sleeping time by two hours.
Conclusions: Health professionals need to discuss sleep issues with individuals with OA and include strategies for coping with these difﬁculties. For reduced night-time pain which may interfere with sleep, additional and appropriate advice about medication is required. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Subjective insomniacs overestimate sleep latency at the beginning of their nocturnal sleep period. It was hypothesized that subjective insomniacs could be trained to accurately estimate sleep latency by learning to differentiate wakefulness from sleep. Ten subjective insomniacs were randomly assigned to one of two groups. Group I subjects participated in both a control and a training week; group 2 subjects participated only during a training week. Each week consisted of a baseline lab night, a training lab night (treatment or control), a home (unmonitored night) and a recovery lab night. During training, subjects were taught to use sleep markers (A, B or C) to help them more accurately estimate sleep latency and were given feedback about the accuracy oftheir estimates. Marker A corresponded to an electroencephalographic level of wakefulness; marker B corresponded to the initial sleep spindle; marker C corresponded to 5 minutes of continuous sleep after the first sleep spindle. In the control condition, subjects had no feedback and were not taught to use markers to help them judge sleep from wakefulness. Total sleep time and percent stage 3 sleep increased, and objective sleep latency decreased on recovery nights. After training, subjective sleep latency, correctness of estimates of sleep versus wakefulness and perceived ability to fall asleep significantly improved. This study helps to establish that subjective insomniacs can learn to more accurately estimate sleep from wakefulness with the use ofsleep-wake markers.

	abstract = {Background: Sleep disturbance is common in patients with opioid use disorder (OUD) receiving medication for addiction treatment. Differences between patients on the two primary agonist medications—methadone and buprenorphine—are not well understood.
Methods: In patients receiving either methadone or buprenorphine treatment for OUD, we examined sleep continuity and architecture using ambulatory monitoring to gather both an objective measure (daily sleep EEG; M = 5.76 days, SD = 1.46) and a subjective measure (daily sleep diary; M = 54.10 days, SD = 25.10) of sleep.
Results: Patients treated with buprenorphine versus methadone did not differ on any measure of sleep continuity or architecture. Women had longer EEG-derived total sleep time than men (d = -0.68, 95 \% CI -1.32 to -0.09), along with lower \%N2 (d = 0.94, 95 \% CI 0.34–1.64) and greater \%N3 (d = -0.94, 95 \% CI -1.61 to -0.32). Selfreported sleep differed from EEG-derived estimates: wake after sleep onset was greater by EEG than by diary (d = 2.58, 95 \% CI 1.74–3.63), and total sleep time and sleep efficiency were lower by EEG than by diary (d for sleep time = 2.93, 95 \% CI 2.06–4.14; d for efficiency = 1.69, 95 \% CI 0.98–2.49).
Conclusions: Patients treated with buprenorphine or methadone did not substantively differ in ambulatory measures of sleep. With both medications, there was a discrepancy between objective and subjective sleep measures. Further confirmatory evidence would inform the development of sleep-related recommendations for OUD patients undergoing agonist treatment.},

The cross-sectional study used a questionnaire battery including the Sleep Anticipatory Anxiety Questionnaire -Adolescent Version (SAAQ-A), completed during school time, followed by eight days of sleep diary completion and wearing wrist actigraphy to obtain subjective and objective sleep onset latency (SOL).
Results: Signiﬁcant relationships were found between somatic arousal (SAAQ-A subscale) and objective SOL and also between sleep-related cognitions (SAAQ-A subscale) and subjective SOL and SOL overestimation (sleep misperception). No relationships were found between subjective SOL and somatic or rehearsal and planning cognitions. Objective SOL was not related to rehearsal and planning and to sleeprelated cognition scores, and sleep misperception had no relationship with somatic as well as rehearsal and planning cognition scores.
Conclusions: These ﬁndings are not only similar to those in clinical adult populations but also notably different, for example, the lack of association between negative sleep-related pre-sleep cognitions and objective sleep difﬁculty. The results of this study provide a basis for a more detailed causal study on the existing relationships between negative pre-sleep cognitions and subjective and objective sleep difﬁculties in this population.},

The Clinician Administered PTSD Scale was administered to assess participants’ trauma exposure and PTSD diagnostic status.
Results: Participants, regardless of their trauma exposure/PTSD status, underestimated WASO in the diary and questionnaire relative to actigraphy and overestimated SOL in the diary relative to PSG. Among participants with current PTSD, TST diary estimates did not differ from the actigraphy measure in contrast with those without current PTSD who overestimated TST. No other significant group differences in discrepancies between subjective and objective sleep measures were found.

This study examined the use of actigraphy in the measurement of sleep of patients with depression and insomnia. Fifty-four patients diagnosed with a current major depressive episode and chronic insomnia underwent a baseline overnight study with concurrent actigraphic and polysomnography (PSG) monitoring, as well as subjective sleep diaries. Agreement between PSG, actigraphy and sleep diary measurements was evaluated using two-tailed t-tests, PearsonÕs correlations and the Bland–Altman concordance technique. The only signiﬁcant difference found between actigraphy and PSG was in latency to persistent sleep, in which actigraphy underestimated sleep latency relative to PSG (P {\textless} 0.05). There were moderate positive correlations between actigraphy and PSG for all variables. In contrast, signiﬁcant differences were observed between sleep diaries and PSG for all sleep variables. Bland–Altman concordance diagrams also demonstrated that, while bias was limited between PSG and the other two measurement types, there were somewhat broad 95\% limits of agreement for all sleep variables with both sleep diaries and actigraphy. In summary, actigraphic measurements of sleep more closely approximated those of PSG than did sleep diaries in this sample of depressed insomniacs.},

Participants: 72 healthy, adult males.
Methods: Analyses were performed on three interrelated studies, all of which consisted of four nights in a sleep laboratory. Following adaptation and baseline nights were two on-call nights (sleep opportunity 23:00 h –07:00 h). Before and after each sleep opportunity, participants provided subjective estimates of sleep. Sleep was objectively measured using polysomnography.
Results: Estimated sleep duration (6.74 ± 1.13 h) and sleep onset latency (20.55 ± 14.85 min) were significantly poorer than objectively measured sleep outcomes (sleep duration 7.21 ± 1.25 h; sleep latency 13.20 ± 10.06 min). Of the variance in post-sleep estimated sleep duration, 14\% was associated with objectively measured minutes of N3 (R2Δ = 0.55) and REM (R2Δ = 0.75). Additionally, 14\% of post-sleep sleep quality estima­ tion variance was associated with minutes of N2 (R2Δ = 0.60) and N3 (R2Δ = 0.79), measured by polysomnography.
Conclusions: Some objective measures of sleep were associated with sub­ jective estimates of sleep duration and sleep quality. However, individuals may overestimate sleep onset latency and underestimate sleep duration during on-call periods. It may be beneficial for on-call workers to actively reflect on feelings of fatigue/alertness for workplace fatigue management, rather than relying solely on estimates of sleep.},

	abstract = {Objective: The present study explores the clinical utility and sensitivity of actigraphy as an outcome measure in the treatment of chronic insomnia. Design: Following a screening-adaptation night, polysomnography, actigraphy, and sleep-diary data were collected in the sleep laboratory for 2 baseline nights and 2 posttreatment nights. Setting: A university-affiliated sleep disorders center. Participants: Seventeen participants with chronic primary insomnia. Mean age was 41.6 years. Interventions: Participants took part in a treatment protocol investigating different sequential treatments for insomnia (these results are reported elsewhere). Measurements and Results: Compared to polysomnography, both actigraphy and sleep-diary instruments underestimated total sleep time and sleep efficiency and overestimated total wake time. Also, actigraphy underestimated sleep-onset latency while the sleep diary overestimated it as compared to polysomnography. Actigraphy data were more accurate than sleep-diary data when compared to polysomnography. Finally, actigraphy was sensitive in detecting the effects of treatment on several sleep parameters. Conclusions: These results suggest that actigraphy is a useful device for measuring treatment response and that it should be used as a complement to sleep-diary evaluation.},

	abstract = {Objective: Actigraphy and sleep diaries have been widely used to evaluate various sleep parameters. However, their agreement in diabetes patients remains unclear. The objective of this study was to examine the agreement between sleep outcomes measured by actigraphy and sleep diaries in aging adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D).
Methods: A convenience sample of 53 T2D adults (aged 50e76 years) were enrolled. Participants wore a wrist ActiGraph and ﬁlled out a daily sleep diary for eight days. Total sleep time (TST), sleep efﬁciency (SE), sleep onset latency (SOL), and wake after sleep onset (WASO) were obtained from the actigraphy and sleep diaries. BlandeAltman plots were conducted to examine the agreement between each sleep outcome.
Results: The differences for TST and SE assessed by actigraphy and sleep diaries were 11.3 min (SD 65.3) and 0.2\% (SD 10.5). BlandeAltman plots revealed wide limits of agreement between actigraphy- and diary-measured TST (95\%CI: À139.3 min, 116.7 min) and SE (95\%CI: À20.9\%, 20.4\%). Systematic biases were present for WASO and SOL: compared to actigraphy, sleep diaries underestimated WASO and overestimated SOL. As the SOL and WASO increased, the agreement became lower.
Conclusion: Overall, the agreement between actigraphy and sleep diaries is poor across all measures in aging adults with T2D patients. Findings from this study highlight the need for sleep researchers and clinicians to consider the method used for sleep assessment when developing interventions or interpreting study ﬁndings.},

In this study, we subjected 22 healthy males (aged 21.8 ± 1.9 years) to a 40-min nap trial followed by 80 min of wakefulness repeated over 28 h, and investigated the relationship between various sleep parameters and the discrepancy ( ST) of time estimation ability (TEA) during sleep, deﬁned by the difference between actual sleep time (ST) and subjective sleep time (sub-ST) in each nap interval. Both ST and sub-ST were signiﬁcant diurnal ﬂuctuations with the peak in the early morning (9 h after dim-light melatonin onset time, 2 h after nadir time of core body temperature rhythm), and subjective sleep duration was estimated to be longer than actual times in all nap intervals (sub-ST {\textgreater} ST). There were signiﬁcant diurnal ﬂuctuations in discrepancy (sub-ST–ST) of TEA during sleep, and the degree of discrepancy correlated positively with increase in the amount of REM sleep and decrease in the amount of slow-wave sleep. These ﬁndings suggest that human TEA operates at a certain level of discrepancy during sleep, and that this discrepancy might be related to the biological clock and its associated sleep architecture.},

	abstract = {Background: The mechanisms involved in sleep perception are not widely known. Therefore, we believe that investigating this phenomenon is the best way to understand some of the mechanisms involved in several sleep disturbances, particularly insomnias.
Objective: The objective of our study was to evaluate sleep perception in insomniacs, sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) patients, and healthy volunteers. Our hypothesis was that insomniacs have less sleep perception than healthy individuals and patients with sleep respiratory disorders.
Methods: We studied 199 individuals who were divided into the following four groups: (1) insomnia group; (2) patients with sleep-disordered breathing; (3) patients with insomnia complaints and an associated sleep respiratory disorder; and (4) healthy individuals with no sleep complaints. All patients were subjected to polysomnography (PSG) followed by a questionnaire addressing their perception about the previous night’s sleep. In addition to analysis of all sleep parameters, we determined sleep perception as the percentage of the ratio between total sleep time perceived by the patient and the total sleep time obtained by PSG.
Results: Sleep perception was signiﬁcantly lower in insomnia patients than in sleep-disordered breathing patients or the normal group. In addition, no signiﬁcant differences across the four groups were observed in sleep efﬁciency and total sleep time.
Conclusions: The results showed that the reported sleep perception of insomniacs is lower than that of sleep-disordered breathing patients or normal individuals. We believe that sleep perception is as important as other commonly measured parameters, such as sleep efﬁciency.},

	abstract = {Background. Worldwide, there are more than 35 million individuals diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease. Many of these individuals are cared for at home by unpaid caregivers who often report high levels of depressive symptoms and depression. The majority of studies conducted to predict which caregivers are at risk for depression have examined non-modiﬁable risk factors. Therefore, it is important to discover modiﬁable factors that may be associated with risk for depression in caregivers.
Objectives. The aims of this research were to identify a set of factors that are modiﬁable and known to be associated with high levels of depression/depressive symptomology (D/DS) in other populations and to determine whether these factors are predictive of D/ DS after controlling for non-modiﬁable, demographic, and clinical factors. Design. Secondary data analysis.
Methods. Fifty-three participants provided direct care to a person with dementia with night-time activity. Inclusion criteria included not undergoing treatment for sleep disorders; living with the care recipient; and a Mini-Mental Status Exam score {\textgreater} 27. Baseline data collected by questionnaires, sleep diary and actigraphy.
Results. In multivariate analyses of the modiﬁable factors, only high levels of negative affect predicted higher levels of depressive symptomatology. When nonmodiﬁable factors were included in the model, negative affect and high levels of perceived caregiver burden predicted 52.6\% of the variance in depressive symptomology. In secondary analyses, wake after sleep onset misperception was associated with higher depression scores.
Conclusions. While negative affect had a moderate effect on depressive symptoms, modiﬁable factors often associated with depressive symptoms in other studies were not associated with caregiver depression in this study. Possibly caregivers’ overall poor sleep causes a ﬂoor effect and masks a potential relationship.},

Methods: This was a secondary analysis of a clincial trial with 59 adults aged 60 years and older with MCI and subsyndromal depression. We included baseline data on participants’ subjective sleep quality, objective sleep efficiency, depressive symptoms, insomnia diagnosis, and cognitive functioning. Results: Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index subjective sleep quality and actigraphy-measured sleep efficiency were not significantly correlated (r ¼ À.06; P ¼ .64), with 61\% of participants having subjective-objective sleep discrepancies. Correlates of subjective-objective sleep discrepancy included the presence of an insomnia diagnosis and impaired memory, particularly delayed memory. Conclusion: These findings are important because subjective underestimation of symptoms in older adults with memory impairments may result in sleep disturbances going unrecognized in clinical practice; on the other hand, an insomnia disorder may be a possible remediable contribution to subjective overestimation of sleep disturbances.},

Method: Among patients with depression, altogether 28 patients with insomnia were examined. Their answers to typical questions, as they are used during a psychiatric interview, were scored. In parallel, night sleep quality and alertness level in the daytime were objectively estimated by means of polygraphic recording.
Results: The subjective statements on the type of insomnia, the estimated time of falling asleep, frequent awakenings and occurrence of disturbing dreams seem to be unreliable. Similarly, the results were disappointing when the patients were asked about alertness disturbances in the daytime. An unexpected finding was the lack of any significant correlation to the scores obtained by means of Epworth's scale. Among the factors possibly influencing the patients' reports, age, sex, coffee intake and also chronic administration of sedatives or hypnotics showed a low correlation with the sleep and alertness indicators.
Conclusion: The statistical evaluation indicated rather poor agreement between the subjective and objective items. The statistical evaluation suggested that anxiety and depression significantly influence reports on sleep quality and alertness disturbances in the daytime.},

Univariate regression analyses were performed to assess the relation between TSTobj and TSTPSQI and TSTbed/wake and compare the relation by sex, race, and ethnicity. Bland-Altman tests were done to assess bias by sex, race/ethnicity, weight status, and sleep quality.
Results: TSTbed/wake correlated with TSTobj (r = .57, P {\textless} .0001). TSTPSQI and TSTbed/wake were greater than TSTobj (0.63 ± 0.99 hours and 0.79 ± 0.76 hours, respectively, both P {\textless} .0001). The difference between TSTPSQI and TSTobj did not vary by sex (β = .12, P = .52), race/ethnicity (β = .15, P = .48), age (β = −.01, P = .27), or body mass index (β = .04, P = .13) whereas that between TSTbed/wake and TSTobj varied by age (β = −.020, P = .0051), BMI (β = .054, P = .0021), race/ethnicity (β = .36, P = .021), and sleep efficiency (β = −.089, P {\textless} .0001).
Conclusions: Calculating TST using self-reported bedtimes and wake times provided TST estimate that correlated with TSTobj but greater over-reporting occurred in younger and heavier individuals, non-whites or Hispanics, and those with low sleep efficiency. In clinical and research settings, asking individuals to report bedtimes, wake times, and length of time to fall asleep may more accurately estimate TST than asking about sleep duration alone.},

	abstract = {Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the clinical correlates of sleep discrepancy and how subjective-objective sleep discrepancy (SD) affects the results of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) in patients with insomnia disorder.
Methods: A total of 33 patients aged {\textgreater}55 years with insomnia disorders participated in this prospective cohort study. Sleep discrepancy (SD) was defined as the difference between the sleep duration derived from the PSG and self-report questionnaires. SD {\textgreater} 2 h was classified as high SD. Self-report questionnaires, and polysomnography (PSG) were performed before 4 weeks of group CBT-I. Statistical analyses were performed to investigate the association of SD with baseline characteristics and CBT-I results, and compare intergroup difference of pre and post-treatment of high SD and low SD.
Results: Patients in the high SD group reported poor subjective sleep, such as lower sleep quality, shorter sleep duration, longer sleep latency, and lower sleep efficiency. However, they had longer sleep duration, higher sleep efficiency in the PSG. There were 35\% males in low SD group, but no males in high SD group. After 4 weeks of group CBT-I, SD was positively associated with the effect of CBT-I on subjective total sleep time (r = 0.499, p {\textless} 0.006) and sleep efficiency (r = 0.463, p = 0.01) after adjusting age, sex and apnea-hypopnea index.
Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that patients in the high SD group may respond better to CBT-I than those in lower SD group. Evaluation of SD may help clinicians to decide tailored treatment strategies for treating insomnia disorders.},

Adolescents (n=225) aged 11-13 years provided estimates for weekday, weekend and combined sleep duration based on self-reported survey data, a 7-day sleep diary, and wrist-worn actigraphy.
Results: We assessed the strength of the relationship as well as agreement levels between subjective and objectively determined sleep duration (weekday, weekend and combined). Subjective diary sleep duration was significantly correlated with actigraphy estimates for weekday and weekend sleep duration r=0.30, p≤0.001 and r=0.31, p≤0.001 respectively. Pitman’s test demonstrated no significant difference in the variance between weekend sleep duration (r=0.09, p=0.16) and combined sleep duration (r=0.12, p=0.08) indicating acceptable agreement between actigraphy and sleep diary sleep duration only. Self-reported sleep duration estimates (weekday, weekend and combined) did not agree with actigraphy determined sleep duration.
Conclusions: Sleep diaries are a cost-effective alternative to survey/questionnaire data. Self-reported measures of sleep duration in adolescents do not agree with actigraphy measures and should be avoided where possible. Previous adolescent sleep studies that have utilized self-reported survey data may not provide a complete representation of sleep on the outcome measure of interest.},

	abstract = {People with insomnia frequently underestimate the duration of their sleep compared to objective polysomnography-measured sleep duration. Cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is the most effective treatment for insomnia and also reduces the degree of sleep underestimation. Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a highly prevalent sleep disorder characterised by frequent narrowing (hypopnoea) and closure (apnoea) of the upper airway during sleep. Comorbid insomnia and sleep apnoea (COMISA) is a prevalent and debilitating disorder. No study has investigated subjectively (sleep diary) versus objectively (polysomnography) measured sleep discrepancies (SOSD) in individuals with COMISA before or following CBT-I. This randomised waitlist-controlled trial investigated SOSD in 145 participants with COMISA before and 6-weeks after CBT-I (n = 72) versus control (n = 73). All participants were studied prior to continuous positive airway pressure treatment for sleep apnoea. At baseline, participants underestimated their total sleep time (mean ± SD −51.9 ± 94.1 min) and sleep efﬁciency (−9.6 ± 18.3\%), and overestimated sleep onset latency (34.5 ± 86.1 min; all p = {\textless} 0.001). Mixed models indicated a main effect of time on reduction of SOSD in both groups, but no between-group difference in the reduction of any SOSD parameters. These ﬁndings may indicate that untreated OSA contributes to a discrepancy between perceived and objective sleep parameters in people with COMISA that is not amenable to CBT-I alone (ACTRN12613001178730).},

	abstract = {Objective: This study aimed to investigate the existence of a difference in quality of life (QOL) between individuals with and without significant subjective-objective discrepancy (SOD) in total sleep time (TST).
Methods: From the Sleep Heart Health Study 2, 2540 individuals who had completed polysomnography, a morning sleep survey, and the 36-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) were included in the analyses. The participants were classified as normoestimators (estimation of TST {\textless}±60 minutes), underestimators (underestimation of TST ≥60 minutes), or overestimators (overestimation of TST ≥60 minutes). The standardized SF-36 QOL scores were compared among the three groups. An adjusted partial correlation analysis was conducted between SOD and QOL.
Results: Of the 2540 participants, 1617 (63.7\%), 433 (17.0\%), and 490 (19.3\%) were assigned to the normoestimator, underestimator, and overestimator groups, respectively. The bodily pain and social functioning components of the SF-36 score were significantly lower in the underestimators than in the normoestimators, whereas the physical functioning component was significantly lower in the overestimators than in the normoestimators. The absolute value of SOD in the TST showed a significant negative correlation with the physical and mental components of the SF-36.
Conclusions: QOL was significantly better in the normoestimator than in the other groups and linearly correlated with the absolute value of SOD. This study suggests that a high prevalence of positive and negative sleep misperception in a community population can be a potential factor associated with poor QOL and potential comorbidities.},

We examined whether opioid dose and age interact in predicting magnitude or direction of discrepancies. Participants (N = 199, M = 51.5 years, SD = 11.7) with FM and insomnia completed 14 days of diaries and actigraphy. Multiple regressions determined whether average opioid dose and its interaction with age predicted magnitude or direction of diary/actigraphy discrepancies in sleep onset latency (SOL), wake after sleep onset (WASO) and sleep efficiency (SE), controlling for sex, use of sleep medication, evening pain and total sleep time. Higher opioid dose predicted greater magnitude of discrepancy in SOL and SE. Opioid dose interacted with age to predict direction but not magnitude of discrepancy in SOL and SE. Specifically, higher opioid use was associated with better subjective (shorter SOL, higher SE) than objective reports of sleep among younger adults, and longer subjective than objectively measured SOL among older adults. Opioid dose did not predict magnitude or direction of WASO discrepancies. In FM, a higher opioid dose increases diary/actigraphy SOL and SE discrepancies, and direction of discrepancies may depend on age. We speculate that increased opioid use combined with age‐related factors, such as slow wave sleep disruption, increased awakenings and/or cognitive decline, may impact perceived sleep.},

	abstract = {Background: The Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) Operational Research Kit-Actigraphy (WORK-A) is a set of unique practice parameters and actigraphy-derived measures for the analysis of operational military sleep patterns. The WORK-A draws on best practices from the literature and comprises 15 additional descriptive variables. Here, we demonstrate the WORK-A with a sample of United States Army Reserve Officers’ Training Corps (ROTC) cadets (n = 286) during a month-long capstone pre-commissioning training exercise.
Methods: The sleep of ROTC cadets (n = 286) was measured by Philips Actiwatch devices during the 31-day training exercise. The preliminary effectiveness of the WORK-A was tested by comparing differences in sleep measures collected by Actiwatches as calculated by Philips Actiware software against WORK-A-determined sleep measures and self-report sleep collected from a subset of ROTC cadets (n = 140).
Results: Actiware sleep summary statistics were significantly different from WORK-A measures and self-report sleep (all P ≤ 0.001). Bedtimes and waketimes as determined by WORK-A major sleep intervals showed the best agreement with self-report bedtime (22:21 ± 1:30 vs. 22:13 ± 0:40, P = 0.21) and waketime (04:30 ± 2:17 vs. 04:31 ± 0: 47, P = 0.68). Though still significantly different, the discrepancy was smaller between the WORK-A measure of time in bed (TIB) for major sleep intervals (352 ± 29 min) and self-report nightly sleep duration (337 ± 57 min, P = 0.006) than that between the WORK-A major TIB and Actiware TIB (177 ± 42, P ≤ 0.001).
Conclusions: Default actigraphy methods are not the most accurate methods for characterizing soldier sleep, but reliable methods for characterizing operational sleep patterns is a necessary first step in developing strategies to improve soldier readiness. The WORK-A addresses this knowledge gap by providing practice parameters and a robust variety of measures with which to profile sleep behavior in service members.},

	abstract = {Purpose Discrepancies between subjective and objective measures of total sleep time (TST) are frequent among insomnia patients, but this issue remains scarcely investigated in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). We aimed to evaluate if sleep perception is affected by the severity of OSA.
Methods We performed a 3-month cross-sectional study of Brazilian adults undergoing overnight polysomnography (PSG). TST was objectively assessed from PSG and by a self-reported questionnaire (subjective measurement). Sleep perception index (SPI) was defined by the ratio of subjective and objective values. Diagnosis of OSA was based on an apnea/hypopnea index (AHI) � 5.0/h, being its severity classified according to AHI thresholds: 5.0–14.9/h (mild OSA), 15.0–29.9/h (moderate OSA), and � 30.0/h (severe OSA).
Results Overall, 727 patients were included (58.0\% males). A significant difference was found in SPI between non-OSA and OSA groups (p = 0.014). Mean SPI values significantly decreased as the OSA severity increased: without OSA (100.1 ± 40.9\%), mild OSA (95.1 ± 24.6\%), moderate OSA (93.5 ± 25.2\%), and severe OSA (90.6 ± 28.2\%), p = 0.036. Using logistic regression, increasing SPI was associated with a reduction in the likelihood of presenting any OSA (p = 0.018), moderate/severe OSA (p = 0.019), and severe OSA (p = 0.028). However, insomnia was not considered as an independent variable for the presence of any OSA, moderate/severe OSA, and severe OSA (all p-values {\textgreater} 0.05).
Conclusion In a clinical referral cohort, SPI significantly decreases with increasing OSA severity, but is not modified by the presence of insomnia symptoms.},

This study examined the impact and durability of cognitive‐behavioural therapy for insomnia on improving the accuracy of sleep and wake perceptions in older adults, and tested whether changes in sleep quality were related to changes in the accuracy of sleep/wake perceptions. One‐hundred and fifty‐nine older veterans (97\% male, mean age 72.2 years) who met diagnostic criteria for insomnia disorder were randomized to: (1) cognitive‐behavioural therapy for insomnia (n = 106); or (2) attention control (n = 53). Assessments were conducted at baseline, post‐treatment, 6months and 12‐months follow‐up. Sleep measures included objective (via wrist actigraphy) and subjective (via self‐report diary) total sleep time and total wake time, along with Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index score. Discrepancy was computed as the difference between objective and subjective estimates of wake and sleep. Minutes of discrepancy were compared between groups across time, as were the relationships between Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index scores and subsequent changes in discrepancy. Compared with controls, participants randomized to cognitive‐behavioural therapy for insomnia became more accurate (i.e. minutes discrepancy was reduced) in their perceptions of sleep/wake at post‐treatment, 6‐months and 12‐months follow‐up (p {\textless} .05). Improved Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index scores at each study assessment preceded and predicted reduced discrepancy at the next study assessment (p {\textless} .05). Cognitive‐behavioural therapy for insomnia reduces sleep/wake discrepancy among older adults with insomnia. The reductions may be driven by improvements in sleep quality. Improving sleep quality appears to be a viable path to improving sleep perception and may contribute to the underlying effectiveness of cognitive‐behavioural therapy for insomnia.},

	abstract = {Sleep disturbances are typical symptoms of acute episodes of bipolar disorder (BD) and differentiate euthymic BD cases from healthy controls (HC). Researchers often employ objective recordings to evaluate sleep patterns, such as actigraphy, whilst clinicians often use subjective ratings, such as the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). As evidence suggests the measures may disagree, we decided to compare subjective (PSQI) and objective (3 weeks of actigraphy) sleep profiles in BD cases and HC (n = 154). We examined whether a dimensional approach helps to illustrate different patterns of sleep disturbances and whether the concordance between subjective and objective recordings varies according to clinical status (BD versus HC). Principal component analysis (PCA) extracted two factors from the PSQI, and separate PCAs of actigraphy recordings extracted two factors for mean values of sleep parameters and one factor for intra-­individual variability. Correlational and linear regression analyses of PCA-­derived dimensions demonstrated that, in both BD and HC, a PSQI “Sleep duration-­efficiency” factor was significantly correlated with an actigraphy “Sleep initiation-­duration” factor. Furthermore, in BD cases only, the PSQI total score and a PSQI “Sleep Impairments” factor were each significantly correlated with an actigraphy “Sleep Variability” factor. Overall, we found that subjective experiences of sleep may be modulated by different components of objectively recorded sleep in BD compared with HC. Also, the use of PCA enabled us to consider the multi-­dimensional nature of subjective sleep, whilst the inclusion of intra-­individual sleep variability afforded a more subtle evaluation of objective sleep.},

Methods—142 insomniacs and 724 controls selected from a general random sample of 1,741 individuals (age ≥ 20 years) underwent a polysomnographic evaluation, completed the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2, and were split into two groups based on their objective sleep duration: “normal sleep duration” (≥ 6 hours) and “short sleep duration” ({\textless} 6 hours).
Results—The discrepancy between subjective and objective sleep duration was determined by two independent factors. Short sleepers reported more sleep than they objectively had and insomniacs reported less sleep than controls with similar objective sleep duration. The additive effect of these two factors resulted in underestimation only in insomniacs with normal sleep duration. Insomniacs with normal sleep duration showed a MMPI-2 profile of high depression and anxiety, and low ego strength, whereas insomniacs with short sleep duration showed a profile of a medical disorder.
Conclusions—Underestimation of sleep duration is prevalent among insomniacs with objective normal sleep duration. Anxious-ruminative traits and poor resources for coping with stress appear to mediate the underestimation of sleep duration. These data further support the validity and clinical utility of objective sleep measures in phenotyping insomnia.},

              Introduction
              Subjective measures may offer practitioners a relatively simple method to monitor recruit responses to basic military training (BMT). Yet, a lack of agreement between subjective and objective measures may presents a problem to practitioners wishing to implement subjective monitoring strategies. This study therefore aims to examine associations between subjective and objective measures of workload and sleep in Australian Army recruits.
            
            
              Materials and Methods
              Thirty recruits provided daily rating of perceived exertion (RPE) and differential RPE (d-RPE) for breathlessness and leg muscle exertion each evening. Daily internal workloads determined via heart rate monitors were expressed as Edwards training impulse (TRIMP) and average heart rate. External workloads were determined via global positioning system (PlayerLoadTM) and activity monitors (step count). Subjective sleep quality and duration was monitored in 29 different recruits via a customized questionnaire. Activity monitors assessed objective sleep measures. Linear mixed-models assessed associations between objective and subjective measures. Akaike Information Criterion assessed if the inclusion of d-RPE measures resulted in a more parsimonious model. Mean bias, typical error of the estimate (TEE) and within-subject repeated measures correlations examined agreement between subjective and objective sleep duration.
            
            
              Results
              Conditional R2 for associations between objective and subjective workloads ranged from 0.18 to 0.78, P \&lt; 0.01, with strong associations between subjective measures of workload and TRIMP (0.65–0.78), average heart rate (0.57–0.73), and PlayerLoadTM (0.54–0.68). Including d-RPE lowered Akaike Information Criterion. The slope estimate between objective and subjective measures of sleep quality was not significant. A trivial relationship (r = 0.12; CI −0.03, 0.27) was observed between objective and subjective sleep duration with subjective measures overestimating (mean bias 25 min) sleep duration (TEE 41 min).
            
            
              Conclusions
              Daily RPE offers a proxy measure of internal workload in Australian Army recruits; however, the current subjective sleep questionnaire should not be considered a proxy measure of objective sleep measures.},

	abstract = {Background and objectives: Misperception of sleep, the underestimation of total sleep time and overestimation of sleep onset latency (SOL) relative to objective measures, is often found in people with sleep disturbances. Theories of insomnia have proposed that perceived sleeplessness triggers excessive intention and eﬀort to sleep, ironically disturbing the normal initiation of sleep. The current study tested this speciﬁc association between (mis)perception of sleep and intrinsic motivation to think about sleep.
Methods: The sample (n = 74) covered students and community living in Munich and surrounds with ages between 18 and 30 years. We assessed the subjective and objective sleep of participants using a sleep diary and actigraphy. Participants also completed a decision-making task (the pay-per-view task), where they had to decide between thinking about sleep vs. eating. As these options were associated with a variable monetary reward, participants typically experienced a conﬂict between their preferred topic and the reward for their choice.
Results: Multilevel logistic regression analyses showed that participants with greater SOL misperception (i.e., longer subjective relative to objective SOL) forgo a greater reward for the opportunity to think about sleep. Limitations: The non-clinical nature of our sample may limit the implication of the ﬁndings for clinical levels of insomnia.
Conclusions: Results support the cognitive model of insomnia, suggesting that perception of sleeplessness is associated with higher intrinsic motivation to engage in sleep-related thinking.},

A high level of intra-individual variability in measures of sleep discrepancy was observed. Multilevel modelling revealed that higher levels of pre-sleep cognitive activity and lower mood upon awakening were signiﬁcantly and independently predictive of the underestimation of total sleep time. Greater levels of sleep effort predicted overestimation of sleep onset latency. These results indicate that psychophysiological variables are related to subjective/objective sleep discrepancy and may be important therapeutic targets in the management of insomnia.},

Results:  Chronic cocaine users accurately reported total sleep time after 1 week of abstinence but overreported total sleep time by an average of 40 min after 2 weeks of abstinence. Underestimating sleep latency and time spent awake after sleep onset were responsible for this difference.

	abstract = {Subjective perception of sleep is not necessarily consistent with electroencephalography (EEG) indications of sleep. The mismatch between subjective reports and objective measures is often referred to as “sleep state misperception.” Previous studies evince that this mismatch is found in both patients with insomnia and in normal sleepers, but the neurophysiological mechanism remains unclear. The aim of the study is to explore the neurophysiological basis of this mechanism, from the perspective of both EEG power and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) fluctuations. Thirty-six healthy young adults participated in the study. Simultaneous EEG and fMRI recordings were conducted while the participants were trying to fall asleep in an MRI scanner at approximately 9:00 pm. They were awakened after achieving stable N1 or N2 sleep, or after 90 min without falling into stable sleep. Next they were asked to recall their conscious experiences from the moment immediately prior to awakening. Sixty-one instances of scheduled awakenings were collected: 21 of these after having achieved stable stage N2 sleep; 12, during stage N1 sleep; and, 20 during the waking state. Relative to those awakenings without subjective–objective discrepancy (n = 27), these awakenings with discrepancy (n = 14) were associated with lower θ power, as well as higher α, β, and γ power. Moreover, we found that participants who exhibited the discrepancy, compared with those who did not, evinced a higher amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation levels in the prefrontal cortex. These results lend support to the conjecture that the subjective–objective discrepancy is associated with central nervous system hyperarousal.},

	abstract = {Methods:  We investigated concordance of self-reported habitual sleep duration compared with actigraphy- and single-night in-home polysomnography (PSG) across white, black, Hispanic, and Chinese participants in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis.
Results:  Among 1910 adults, self-reported sleep duration, determined by differences between bed and wake times, was overestimated in all racial groups compared with PSG and actigraphy. Compared with whites (ρ = 0.45), correlations were significantly lower only in blacks (ρ = 0.28). Self-reporting bias for total sleep time compared with wrist actigraphy was 66 min (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 61–71) for whites, 58 min (95\% CI: 48–69) for blacks, 66 min (95\% CI: 57–74) for Hispanics, and 60 min (95\% CI: 49–70) for Chinese adults. Compared with PSG, self-reporting bias in whites at 73 min (95\% CI: 67–79) was higher than in blacks (54 min [95\% CI: 42–65]) and Chinese (49 min [95\% CI: 37–61]) but not different from Hispanics (67 min [95\% CI: 56–78]). Slight agreement/concordance was observed between self-reported and actigraphybased total sleep time (kw = 0.14 for whites, 0.10 for blacks, 0.17 for Hispanics, and 0.11 for Chinese) and PSG (kw = 0.08 for whites, 0.04 for blacks, 0.05 for Hispanics, and 0.01 for Chinese) across race/ethnicity.
Conclusions:  Self-reported sleep duration overestimated objectively measured sleep across all races, and compared with PSG, overestimation is significantly greater in whites compared with blacks. Larger reporting bias reduces the ability to identify significant associations between sleep duration and health among blacks compared with whites. Sleep measurement property differences should be considered when comparing sleep indices across racial/ethnic groups.},

	abstract = {Objectives:  Sleep discrepancies are common in primary insomnia (PI) and include reports of longer sleep onset latency (SOL) than measured by polysomnography (PSG) or “negative SOL discrepancy.” We hypothesized that negative SOL discrepancy in PI would be associated with higher relative glucose metabolism during nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep in brain networks involved in conscious awareness, including the salience, left executive control, and default mode networks.
Methods:  PI (n = 32) and good sleeper controls (GS; n = 30) completed [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scans during NREM sleep, and relative regional cerebral metabolic rate for glucose (rCMRglc) was measured. Sleep discrepancy was calculated by subtracting PSG-measured SOL on the PET night from corresponding self-report values the following morning. We tested for interactions between group (PI vs. GS) and SOL discrepancy for rCMRglc during NREM sleep using both a region of interest mask and exploratory whole-brain analyses.
Results:  Significant group by SOL discrepancy interactions for rCMRglc were observed in several brain regions (pcorrected {\textless} .05 for all clusters). In the PI group, more negative SOL discrepancy (self-reported {\textgreater} PSG-measured SOL) was associated with significantly higher relative rCMRglc in the right anterior insula and middle/posterior cingulate during NREM sleep. In GS, more positive SOL discrepancy (self-reported {\textless} PSG-measured SOL) was associated with significantly higher relative rCMRglc in the right anterior insula, left anterior cingulate cortex, and middle/posterior cingulate cortex.
Conclusions:  Although preliminary, these findings suggest regions of the brain previously shown to be involved in conscious awareness, and the perception of PSG-defined states may also be involved in the phenomena of SOL discrepancy.},

Results: Signiﬁcant differences were found between subjective and objective sleep data in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). For patients with more severe depression, subjective measurements obtained using sleep logs, such as total sleep time and sleep efﬁciency, were signiﬁcantly lower than those obtained using actigraphy by controlling for demographics.

Objective: This study aimed to elucidate the socio-demographic, brain-injury-related, and clinical char­ acteristics that underlie accuracy of sleep duration reporting in mTBI/concussion.
Methods: Thirty-seven participants diagnosed with mTBI/concussion (57\% male, 47.54 ± 11.3 years old) underwent clinical and neuroimaging examinations, full-night PSG, and estimated sleep duration following PSG.
Results: Mean self-reported sleep duration was 342 ± 93.6 minutes and PSG-measured sleep duration was 382 ± 76.8 minutes. Measurements were moderately correlated (rho = 0.46, p = .004). Age associated with self- and PSG-measured sleep duration (rho = 0.34 and rho = 0.84, respectively, p {\textless} .05). Self-reported sleep duration was uniquely associated with insomnia severity (rho = −0.48, p = .002). In the fully adjusted multivariable regression analysis, several clinical characteristics of patients explained 30\% of the discre­ pancy between self- and PSG-measured sleep duration.
Conclusion: The observed results indicate that persons with mTBI do not accurately assess their sleep duration and, therefore, PSG is warranted in clinical situations where sleep duration is of concern.},

	abstract = {Feeling awake although sleep recordings indicate clear-cut sleep sometimes occurs in good sleepers and to an extreme degree in patients with so-called paradoxical insomnia. It is unknown what underlies sleep misperception, as standard polysomnographic (PSG) parameters are often normal in these cases. Here we asked whether regional changes in brain activity could account for the mismatch between objective and subjective total sleep times (TST). To set cutoffs and define the norm, we first evaluated sleep perception in a population-based sample, consisting of 2,092 individuals who underwent a full PSG at home and estimated TST the next day. We then compared participants with a low mismatch (normoestimators, n = 1,147, ±0.5 SD of mean) with those who severely underestimated (n = 52, {\textless}2.5th percentile) or overestimated TST (n = 53, {\textgreater}97.5th percentile). Compared with normoestimators, underestimators displayed higher electroencephalographic (EEG) activation (beta/delta power ratio) in both rapid eye movement (REM) and non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, while overestimators showed lower EEG activation (significant in REM sleep). To spatially map these changes, we performed a second experiment, in which 24 healthy subjects and 10 insomnia patients underwent high-density sleep EEG recordings. Similarly to underestimators, patients displayed increased EEG activation during NREM sleep, which we localized to central-posterior brain areas. Our results indicate that a relative shift from low- to high-frequency spectral power in central-posterior brain regions, not readily apparent in conventional PSG parameters, is associated with underestimation of sleep duration. This challenges the concept of sleep misperception, and suggests that instead of misperceiving sleep, insomnia patients may correctly perceive subtle shifts toward wake-like brain activity.},

Results  The accelerometer-measured and self-reported sleep duration were 6.01 (SD 1.48) and 6.88 (SD 1.40) h/day, respectively, representing a 0.87 h/day of over-reporting (SD 1.90, p {\textless} 0.001). Such an over-reporting was observed in all subgroups, where the over-reporting ranged from 0.72 (those aged 41–50) to 1.13 h/day (those aged 71 or above). The correlation between accelerometer-measured and self-reported sleep duration was low (ρ = 0.14, p {\textless} 0.001).

	abstract = {Purpose  Little is known regarding the prevalence of sleep state misperception and the factors related to this in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).
Methods  This retrospective study included patients with OSA defined by an apnea–hypopnea index (AHI) of ≥ 5 and used the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), the Epworth sleepiness scale, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7. Underestimation and overestimation of sleep state perception were defined as {\textless} 80\% and {\textgreater} 120\%, respectively, of the ratio between subjective and objective total sleep time. An ISI score {\textgreater} 14 indicated clinically significant insomnia and an AHI ≥ 30 indicated severe OSA. A multinomial logistic regression was conducted with the category of sleep state perception as an outcome variable.
Results  Of the 707 patients with OSA, underestimation and overestimation of sleep state perception were noted in 22.5\% and 10.6\% of subjects, respectively. The median absolute differences (and percentages of the ratio) between subjective and objective total sleep time were 116 min (66.9\%) and 87 min (127.3\%) in the underestimated and overestimated perception groups, respectively. In the adjusted model, the underestimated group was more likely to have an ISI score {\textgreater} 14 (OR = 1.812, P = .006). The overestimated group was more likely to be older (OR = 1.025, P = .025) and has severe OSA (OR = 1.729, P = .035).
Conclusions  There are two patterns of sleep state misperception in patients with OSA: underestimation associated with comorbid insomnia symptoms and overestimation associated with severe OSA. These findings enhance understanding of the pathophysiology of sleep state misperception in patients with OSA.},

	abstract = {We aimed to investigate the effect of increased sleep pressure and shortened sleep duration on subjective sleep perception in relation to electroencephalographic sleep measures. We analyzed the data from a study in which 14 healthy male volunteers had completed a baseline assessment with 8 hr time in bed, a sleep deprivation (40 hr of wakefulness) and a sleep restriction protocol with 5 hr time in bed during 7 nights. In this work, we assessed perception index, derived through dividing the subjectively perceived total sleep time, wake after sleep onset and sleep latency duration by the objectively measured one at each condition. We found that total sleep time was subjectively underestimated at baseline and shifted towards overestimation during sleep restriction and after deprivation. This change in accuracy of subjective estimates was not associated with any changes in sleep architecture or sleep depth. Wake after sleep onset was significantly underestimated only during sleep restriction. Sleep latency was always overestimated subjectively without any significant change in this misperception across conditions. When comparing accuracy of subjective and actimetry estimates, subjective estimates regarding total sleep time and wake after sleep onset deviated less from electroencephalography derived measures during sleep restriction and after deprivation. We conclude that selfassessments and actimetry data of patients with chronic sleep restriction should be interpreted cautiously. The subjectively decreased perception of wake after sleep onset could lead to overestimated sleep efficiency in such individuals, whereas the underestimation of sleep time and overestimation of wake after sleep onset by actimetry could lead to further underestimated sleep duration.},

	abstract = {Background: There is growing interest in the potential for wearable and mobile devices to deliver clinically relevant information in real-world contexts. However, there is limited information on their acceptability and barriers to long-term use in people living with psychosis.
Objective: This study aimed to describe the development, implementation, feasibility, acceptability, and user experiences of the Sleepsight platform, which harnesses consumer wearable devices and smartphones for the passive and unobtrusive capture of sleep and rest-activity profiles in people with schizophrenia living in their homes.
Methods: A total of 15 outpatients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia used a consumer wrist-worn device and smartphone to continuously and remotely gather rest-activity profiles over 2 months. Once-daily sleep and self-rated symptom diaries were also collected via a smartphone app. Adherence with the devices and smartphone app, end-of-study user experiences, and agreement between subjective and objective sleep measures were analyzed. Thresholds for acceptability were set at a wear time or diary response rate of 70\% or greater.
Results: Overall, 14 out of 15 participants completed the study. In individuals with a mild to moderate symptom severity at baseline (mean total Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale score 58.4 [SD 14.4]), we demonstrated high rates of engagement with the wearable device (all participants meeting acceptability criteria), sleep diary, and symptom diary (93\% and 86\% meeting criteria, respectively), with negative symptoms being associated with lower diary completion rate. The end-of-study usability and acceptability questionnaire and qualitative analysis identified facilitators and barriers to long-term use, and paranoia with study devices was not a significant barrier to engagement. Comparison between sleep diary and wearable estimated sleep times showed good correspondence (ρ=0.50, P{\textless}.001).
Conclusions: Extended use of wearable and mobile technologies are acceptable to people with schizophrenia living in a community setting. In the future, these technologies may allow predictive, objective markers of clinical status, including early markers of impending relapse.},

	abstract = {Background  Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is a first-line therapy for insomnia disorders. We assessed changes in discrepancies between subjective and objective sleep measures and correlations between discrepancy changes and clinical insomnia severity for CBT-I in patients with primary insomnia
Methods  Fifty-two outpatients (mean age, 60.3 years; 26 women) with primary insomnia were treated by individual CBT-I (50 min, maximum six sessions, once every 1–2 weeks). One week before and after CBT-I, patients recorded a sleep log and wore an actigraphy device. Subjective and objective time in bed (TIB), total sleep time (TST), sleep-onset latency (SOL), wake time after sleep onset (WASO), and sleep efficiency (SE) were evaluated by averaging 1-week records. Relative values of sleep discrepancy in TIB, TST, SOL, WASO, and SE were calculated for estimating effects of CBT-I. The therapeutic effects were also evaluated using psychological scales before and after CBT-I.
Results  Subjective and objective discrepancies in sleep measures decreased by 36, 25, and 37 min in TST, SOL, and WASO, respectively, and 7\% in SE (all P {\textless} 0.001) after CBT-I. Seven patients transitioned from underestimating SE before CBT-I to overestimating SE after CBT-I. Although CBT-I improved relative values of discrepancy in WASO and SE, alongside ISI, the improvement in insomnia severity only correlated with SOL discrepancy.
Conclusions  CBT-I may reduce the discrepancy between subjective and objective sleep measures in patients with primary insomnia. However, a greater therapeutic effect of CBT-I was observed in reducing the ISI, which was slightly influenced by improvements in sleep discrepancies.},

	abstract = {Purpose  This study was aimed to determine the magnitude and predictors of self-reported short/long sleep duration (SDUR) reclassifications using objective measurements.
Methods  Adult participants from the ELSA-Brasil study performed self-reported SDUR, 7-day wrist actigraphy, and a portable sleep study. We explored two strategies of defining self-reported SDUR reclassification: (1) short and long SDUR defined by {\textless}6 and ≥8h, respectively; (2) reclassification using a large spectrum of SDUR categories ({\textless}5, 5–6, 7–8, 8–9, and {\textgreater}9 h).
Results  Data from 2036 participants were used in the final analysis (43\% males; age: 49±8 years). Self-reported SDUR were poorly correlated (r=0.263) and presented a low agreement with actigraphy-based total sleep time. 58\% of participants who self-reported short SDUR were reclassified into the reference (6–7.99 h) or long SDUR groups using actigraphy data. 88\% of participants that self-reported long SDUR were reclassified into the reference and short SDUR. The variables independently associated with higher likelihood of self-reported short SDUR reclassification included insomnia (3.5-fold), female (2.5-fold), higher sleep efficiency (1.35-fold), lowest O­ 2 saturation (1.07-fold), higher wake after sleep onset (1.08-fold), and the higher number of awakening (1.05-fold). The presence of hypertension was associated with a 3.4-fold higher chance of self-reported long SDUR reclassification. Analysis of five self-reported SDUR categories revealed that the more extreme is the SDUR, the greater the self-reported SDUR reclassification.
Conclusion  In adults, we observed a significant rate of short/long SDUR reclassifications when comparing self-reported with objective data. These results underscore the need to reappraise subjective data use for future investigations addressing SDUR.},

The present study was carried out to collect ample data on neurophysiology and subjective experience of sleep and on daytime cognitive performance to clarify this point. A sample of 128 primar)' insomniacs was investigated with polysomnography (PSG) that was submitted to a computerized, automatic analysis of alpha activity during sleep. It yielded two groups of 64 Ss each with a normal, that is, nonalpha sleep EEG and with alpha-sleep, respectively. Contrasting the two groups for PSG showed that alpha sleep Ss had significantly more stage 4 and a (nonsignificant) tendency for more awakenings. Subjectively, they largely underestimated intermittent wake time and consequently overestimated sleep duration by 50 min. The performance test batter), showed a difference in one test only, that is, a better short-term memory function by alpha sleep Ss. In conclusion, there was no result supporting the assumption that alpha sleep is less restorative, but a significant lack of perception of intermittent awakenings during night sleep by alpha sleep Ss was found. The authors propose an explanation and point to the implications this misperception might have for the clinician.},

	abstract = {Discrepancies between actigraphic and self-reported sleep measures are common. Studies of people with insomnia, in whom both sleep disturbances and discrepancy are common, suggest disturbances and discrepancy reflect differences in the sleeping brain's activity measurable using spectral electroencephalogram (EEG). Disentangling effects of discrepancy and disturbance on sleep EEG could help target research on the consequences and treatments of different sleep phenotypes. We therefore categorized participants in a cohort study including 2,850 men (average age = 76 years, standard deviation = 5.5) into four groups using median splits on actigraphic and self-reported sleep efficiency (SE). We compared spectral power between these groups in 1-Hz bins up to 24 Hz. Compared with the concordant-high SE group: (a) the group with high actigraphic and low self-reported SE had higher spectral power from 11–15 Hz across the night; (b) both groups with low actigraphic SE had higher power across the 15–24 Hz range, predominantly in early cycles, and greater slow frequency power in later cycles. These findings suggest that perceived wakefulness undetected by actigraphy may result from or drive activity corresponding to spindles. We also found, consistent with hyperarousal models, that low SE detectable via actigraphy was related to higher frequency power in the beta range; actigraph-measured inefficiency was also associated with later slow oscillations, potentially representing attempts to dissipate homeostatic drive elevated from earlier hyperarousal. These distinct spectral EEG markers (of low SE measured with actigraphy vs. low perceived SE that is not captured by actigraphy) may have different causes or consequences.},

	abstract = {There is extensive laboratory research studying the effects of acute sleep deprivation on biological and cognitive functions, yet much less is known about naturalistic patterns of sleep loss and the potential impact on daily or weekly functioning of an individual. Longitudinal studies are needed to advance our understanding of relationships between naturalistic sleep and fluctuations in human health and performance, but it is first necessary to understand the efficacy of current tools for long-term sleep monitoring. The present study used wrist actigraphy and sleep log diaries to obtain daily measurements of sleep from 30 healthy adults for up to 16 consecutive weeks. We used non-parametric Bland-Altman analysis and correlation coefficients to calculate agreement between subjectively and objectively measured variables including sleep onset time, sleep offset time, sleep onset latency, number of awakenings, the amount of wake time after sleep onset, and total sleep time. We also examined compliance data on the submission of daily sleep logs according to the experimental protocol. Overall, we found strong agreement for sleep onset and sleep offset times, but relatively poor agreement for variables related to wakefulness including sleep onset latency, awakenings, and wake after sleep onset. Compliance tended to decrease significantly over time according to a linear function, but there were substantial individual differences in overall compliance rates. There were also individual differences in agreement that could be explained, in part, by differences in compliance. Individuals who were consistently more compliant over time also tended to show the best agreement and lower scores on behavioral avoidance scale (BIS). Our results provide evidence for convergent validity in measuring sleep onset and sleep offset with wrist actigraphy and sleep logs, and we conclude by proposing an analysis method to mitigate the impact of non-compliance and measurement errors when the two methods provide discrepant estimates.},

We evaluated physical activity and sleep-related measures and discussed the potential application of such devices for large-scale step and sleep data acquisition. To that end, we conducted two separate studies. In Study 1, we evaluated the performance of MB by comparing it to the GT3X (ActiGraph, wGT3X-BT), a scientiﬁc actigraph used in research, as well as subjective sleep reports. In Study 2, we distributed the MB across four countries (Austria, Germany, Cuba, and Ukraine) and investigated physical activity and sleep among these countries. The results of Study 1 indicated that MB step counts correlated highly with the scientiﬁc GT3X device, but did display biases. In addition, the MB-derived wake-up and total-sleep-times showed high agreement with subjective reports, but partly deviated from GT3X predictions. Study 2 revealed similar MB step counts across countries, but signiﬁcant later wake-up and bedtimes for Ukraine than the other countries. We hope that our studies will stimulate future large-scale sensor-based physical activity and sleep research studies, including various cultures.},

We hypothesized that the PSQI and its factor structure would be valid in premenopausal women. Materials and Methods: We performed a validation study of the PSQI against wrist actigraphy in a communitybased convenience sample of 71 healthy premenopausal women (aged 40–50 years). For convergent validity, PSQI and its component scores were compared with homologous actigraphy measures. For discriminant validity, characteristics known to affect sleep quality were compared, including body mass index, exercise, menopausal status, menopausal symptoms, and depressive symptoms measured with the Center for Epidemiological Studies–Depression (CES-D) Scale.
Results: The PSQI global score and Components 1 (quality) and 5 (disturbance) were correlated ( p {\textless} 0.05) with actigraphy-measured wake after sleep onset. The PSQI global score and Components 1 (quality) and 7 (daytime dysfunction) were correlated with CES-D scores. PSQI Components 2 (onset latency) and 4 (efﬁciency) were not congruent with homologous actigraphy measures, while component 3 (duration) was congruent with actigraphy duration. The single-factor PSQI global score had a higher McDonald’s omega (0.705) and Cronbach’s alpha (0.702) than the two-factor or three-factor models.
Conclusions: The PSQI global score is a valid measure of sleep quality in healthy midlife women, performing better than two-factor or three-factor models. However, overlapping CES-D and PSQI scores warrant further clinical assessment and research to better differentiate poor sleep quality from depression.},

	abstract = {Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the agreement between self-reported sleep measures and insomnia with objectively measured sleep parameters in people with HIV (PWH) and HIV-negative individuals. Design: A cross-sectional analysis of PWH and lifestyle-similar HIV-negative individuals.
Methods: Self-reported measures included time spent in bed, sleep onset latency and a validated insomnia questionnaire. Objective measures were assessed via 7-days/nights of actigraphy data to determine average and intra-individual variability of several sleep measures (including time spent in bed and onset latency). Spearman’s correlation coefﬁcient and Cohen’s k were used to assess the agreement between self-reported and actigraphy-assessed measures. Associations between insomnia and actigraphy-assessed sleep parameters were evaluated using partial least-square discriminant analysis (PLS-DA).
Results: We found fair correlation between self-reported and actigraphy-assessed time spent in bed in 342 PWH (rs ¼ 0.46) and 119 HIV-negative individuals (rs ¼ 0.48). Among PWH, the correlation did not differ by age, education, depressive symptoms and self-reported insomnia (all P {\textgreater} 0.05), but was stronger in men (P ¼ 0.05) and in those with a BMI of at least 25 kg/m2 (P {\textless} 0.001). Agreement between self-reported and actigraphy-assessed sleep onset latency was poor in both PWH (k ¼ 0.002, P ¼ 0.49) and HIV-negative individuals (k ¼ 0.009, P ¼ 0.65). According to PLS-DA, self-reported insomnia most strongly correlated with intra-individual variability of sleep duration, movement index and efﬁciency.
Conclusion: We report poor-to-fair agreement between self-reported and actigraphyassessed sleep measures in PWH. Insomnia symptoms correlated with regularity of sleep duration, quality and efﬁciency. These ﬁndings highlight the importance of both patientreported and objective measures of daily sleep variation, for better understanding sleep disorders in PWH.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The validity of sleep quality and quantity indices as reported by schoolchildren has not been established. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the relationship between subjective sleep habits estimation and objective measurement data in schoolchildren.
METHODS: The study consisted of 42 healthy junior high school children aged 13-14. Sleep log information was gathered over 7 consecutive days, using a sleep-monitoring device (Actiwatch®) and a questionnaire which covered the following aspects for sleep quality and quantity: bed time, sleep latency, sleep start, sleep end, wake up and assumed sleep length. The means of the sleep indices for 5 weekdays were used for analysis. Pearson's correlation coefficients and paired t-tests were used to evaluate the correlation and difference between subjective and objective sleep parameters.
RESULTS: The correlation coefficient between subjective and objective records was 0.49 (p{\textless}0.001) for sleep latency, 0.99 (p{\textless}0.001) for sleep start time, 0.99 (p{\textless}0.001) for sleep end time, and 0.97 (p{\textless}0.001) for assumed sleep length. The difference between subjective and objective records was 7.67 min (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 4.64-10.71) for sleep latency, and 0:02 min (95\% CI: −0:01-0:05) for sleep start time, 0:02 min (95\% CI: 0:01-0:03) for sleep end time, and 8.19 min (95\% CI: 4.93-11.45) for assumed sleep length.
CONCLUSIONS: Although children tended to overestimate sleeping hours, the correlation between subjective and objective sleep indices except sleep latency was quite high. Thus, children's sleep questionnaire can be applied to surveys for sleep habits screening.},

	abstract = {Introduction: There are only few agreement studies between subjective measures of sleep and actigraphy among adolescents. Objective: To compare self‑reported sleep and actigraphy in this age group, by studying gender differences and, using a new graphical approach, the survival agreement plot. Methods: Thirty‑seven subjects, aged 12 to 17 years, answered questions about nocturnal sleep duration and used actigraphy for seven days. The mean and median differences between the informed sleep and the recorded one, the intraclass correlation coefficient, the Bland‑Altman plot and the survival‑agreement plot were used. Results: A mean difference of about one hour (SD = 2.1; median = 0.5; p {\textless} 0.01) was found between both strategies, which was higher among boys, 1.9 hours (SD = 2.8; median = 1.6; p {\textless} 0.05), than among girls, 0.5 hours (SD = 1.4; median = 0.3; p = 0.11). The graphical evaluation showed similar results, as well as the intraclass correlation coefficient: 0.06 (95\%CI = ‑0.33 – 0.46; p = 0.489) for boys and 0.43 (95\%CI = 0.12 – 0.83; p {\textless} 0.001) for girls. Conclusions: Our data are consistent with previous studies as to non‑agreement between the two methods. These results are relevant because this is the first study of concordance between subjective measures of sleep and actigraphy among Brazilian adolescents, as far as we know. In addition, they reinforce the need of a careful use of nocturnal sleep measures among adolescents, mainly among boys.},

	abstract = {Background: The importance of maternal sleep and its contribution to maternal and fetal health during pregnancy is increasingly being recognised. However, the ability to accurately recall sleep practices during pregnancy has been questioned. The aim of this study is to test the accuracy of recall of normal sleep practices in late pregnancy.
Methods: Thirty healthy women between 35 and 38 weeks of gestation underwent level III respiratory polysomnography (PSG) with infrared digital video recordings in their own homes. Data regarding sleep positions, number of times getting out of bed during the night and respiratory measures were collected. A sleep questionnaire was administered the morning after the recorded sleep. Continuous data were assessed using Spearman’s Rho and Bland-Altman. Cohen’s Kappa was used to assess recall in the categorical variables.
Results: Two-thirds of participants went to sleep on their left side. There was good agreement in sleep onset position between video and questionnaire data (Kappa 0.52), however the there was poor agreement on position on wakening (Kappa 0.24). The number of times getting out of bed during the night was accurately recalled (Kappa 0.65). Twenty five out of 30 participants snored as recorded by PSG. Questionnaire data was inaccurate for this measure. Bland-Altman plots demonstrated acceptable agreement between video and questionnaire data for estimated sleep duration, but not the time taken to fall asleep (sleep latency). One participant had mild obstructive sleep apnoea and another probable high upper airways resistance.
Conclusions: Sleep onset position, sleep duration and the number of times getting out of bed during the night were accurately recalled, but sleep latency and sleep position on waking were not. This study identifies the sleep variables that can be accurately obtained by questionnaire and those that cannot.},

	abstract = {Background and objectives: Misperception of sleep (e.g., underestimation of sleep time relative to objective measures) is a common feature of insomnia and other psychopathologies. To elucidate the mechanisms underlying this tendency, we examined the role of pre-sleep cognitive arousal and overgeneralization.
Methods: We monitored the sleep of 54 community dwellers (the majority being university students), using actigraphy and a sleep diary for 7 days. Immediately after this period, the participants provided an additional global evaluation of their sleep for the past week. In this global evaluation, participants were asked to estimate their average number of hours of sleep and the duration of time taken to fall asleep (sleep onset latency) across the past seven nights.
Results: Single-night misperceptions (difference between actigraphy and sleep diary estimations) of sleep time and sleep onset latency were signiﬁcantly associated with pre-sleep cognitive arousal, but not with overgeneralization. In contrast, global misperception of sleep (difference between sleep diary and global estimations) were associated with overgeneralization, but not with cognitive arousal. Limitations: Our sample mainly consisted of female university students, which limits the generalizability of the results.
Conclusions: Misperception of sleep occurs in two cases: (1) in the case of a single night due to excessive arousal, and (2) in the case of multiple nights due to overgeneralization. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

As more attention is being paid to the sleep problems of HF patients, it is important to evaluate the degree of congruence between subjective and objective sleep measurements in this patient group.
Purpose: This study was developed to evaluate the congruence between sleep parameters as measured using a wristworn ActiGraph and a daily sleep log in patients with stable HF.
Methods: Forty-three HF patients aged 40–92 years served as subjects. Sleep parameters were derived from actigraphy and a daily sleep log by averaging scores for 7 nights.
Results: There were significant differences in wake time after sleep onset (WASO) and total sleep time between the sleep log and the ActiGraph (both ps G .001). Neither WASO nor sleep onset latency, both derived from the sleep log, correlated significantly with actigraphy variables. The mean bias for WASO and total sleep time between methods was 54.1 min (SD = 47.5 min) and 109.3 min (SD = 91.68 min) as assessed using a Bland–Altman analysis. A majority (83.7\%) of participants experienced sleep disturbances as assessed by actigraphy. However, fewer (53.5\%) had sleep disturbances as assessed using the sleep log.
Conclusion: A considerable degree of incongruence between actigraphy- and sleep log–derived measures of sleep exists in patients with stable HF.},

Twelve normal young adult subjects slept in the laboratory for 5 consecutive nights. Each subject was briefly awakened five times on each night, and subjective state, auditory arousal threshold, and sleep/wake time estimation data were collected. The threshold of sleep onset (i.e., the point at which a report of sleep was given 50\% of the time) occurred 2-4 min after the first sleep spindle. In contrast, auditory thresholds rose rapidly within 1 min of the first sleep spindle. The threshold data corroborate the appearance of a sleep spindle as an objective measure of sleep onset. However, subjective sleep onset appears to be a relatively lengthy period during which perception of state is blurred and uncertain. Key Words: Sleep onset-Subjective sleep onset-Arousal threshold.},

	abstract = {Background: To date, clinical pain research has typically used subjective questionnaires to assess effectiveness of treatment. However, in the near future, new technologies may provide us objective outcome measures as an alternative to self-report. The goal of this study is to compare subjective and objective sleep assessments in a population of failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS) patients, treated with spinal cord stimulation (SCS).
Methods: Twenty-two patients diagnosed with FBSS received SCS. Sleep data was collected at three time point: prior to SCS implantation (B), one month after SCS (T1), and two months after SCS (T2). Sleep data measured by actigraphy provided objective sleep data and were compared to Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) scores. Agreement between sleep parameters, total sleep time (TST), sleep efﬁciency (SE), and sleep onset latency (SOL), was examined.
Results: Nineteen out of 22 patients completed the study. We identiﬁed signiﬁcant differences between objective and subjective measurements for TST and SE at baseline and after two months of SCS, with patients underestimating both parameters on the PSQI in comparison to objective measurements. For SOL no signiﬁcant differences were found, although patients subjectively overestimated SOL at B.
Conclusion: The results about sleep measurements shown in this population of chronic pain patients, suggest that the subjective ratings scored worse than the objective measurements. Second, short-term SCS mainly seems to affect subjectively measured sleep parameters, especially SOL. This study shows the discrepancies between objective and subjective assessments in chronic pain research. Objective tools are indispensable for a correct assessment and treatment of sleep parameters. They are also playing a role as a biofeedback tool and are supporting the rehabilitation process.},

	abstract = {Purpose  This study aims to evaluate if gender influences the sleep duration perception in adults referred for polysomnography (PSG).
Methods  A cross-sectional study was undertaken from December 2019 to January 2021. Total sleep time was objectively assessed from the overnight PSG and subjectively estimated. The sleep perception index (SPI) was defined by the ratio of subjective and objective values. Diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) was based on an apnea–hypopnea index ≥ 5.0/h. Insomnia was defined by the presence of one or more specific complaints: difficulty falling asleep, difficulty maintaining sleep, and/or waking up earlier than desired. The association between continuous variables and SPI was assessed by linear regression analysis.
Results  This study enrolled 2,004 outpatients (56\% men) who were grouped into four subsamples: controls (n = 139), insomnia (n = 154), OSA (n = 912), and insomnia comorbid with OSA [COMISA] (n = 799). In women, the median SPI differed among groups and ranged from 89 to 102\% (p = 0.001); while in men, it ranged from 90\% to 99\% (p = 0.007). However, no gender-related SPI value differences emerged within each of the subgroups: controls (p = 0.907), insomnia (p = 0.830), OSA (p = 0.070), and COMISA (p = 0.547). The presence of insomnia (β, − 0.101, p {\textless} 0.001) or OSA (β, − 0.082, p = 0.001), but not gender (β, − 0.017, p = 0.612), were independent predictors of the SPI.
Conclusion  In a clinical referral cohort, no evidence of sex dimorphism emerged for SPI irrespective of the underlying sleep diagnosis.},

	abstract = {This study was motivated by one of the important challenges in sleep research: estimating not only an overall association between objective and subjective sleep measures but at within- and between-subject levels as well. Comparing to the literature on the association between two continuous or two binary outcomes, to our knowledge, fewer works were published for the case when one outcome is continuous and the other is binary while both are measured repeatedly. We address this problem by considering a latent correlation (LC) that is the correlation between two continuous outcomes. The first is the original observed continuous outcome while the second is an underlying latent variable, dichotomization of which produces the original binary outcome. Building upon a flexible Bayesian generalized linear mixed model fitted by the MCMC, our proposal allows estimation of the total correlation, and the between- and within-subject correlations simultaneously. The goal of joint estimation of all these correlations, to our knowledge, was not fulfilled in previous proposals (either the between- or within-subject correlation needed to be fixed at zero). Moreover, the approach avoids bias of a two-step procedure and does not rely on approximation of the covariance matrix and hence the correlations. It provides accurate estimates covering a wide range of values. We can also incorporate the cases of missing data, covariate adjustment, and comparison between subgroups. Furthermore, these advantages are achieved at a low computational cost. We demonstrate properties and implementation of our proposal with a large simulation study and with real data from two clinical trials of an insomnia drug where one of the questions is how continuous biomarkers derived from the polysomnographic measurements are associated with the binary patient-reported sleep quality.

	abstract = {COVID-19 has become a long-term problem, and global pandemic conditions may persist for years. Researchers are providing mounting evidence of relationships between COVID-19 lockdowns and sleep problems. However, few studies have investigated the impact of home isolation on sleep time perception, especially in comparable social isolation situations with similar pressures. Subjective sleep time perception parameters were derived from sleep diaries. Objective parameters were derived from actigraphy. Subjective and objective data were obtained between February 17 and February 27, 2020 from 70 adult participants subject to COVID-19 related lockdown provisions in China. We divided participants into a home stayers (HS) group (subject to full stay-at home orders) and an area-restricted workers (ARW) group (permitted to work at their nearby workplaces). The HS group demonstrated significantly delayed actigraphy-defined sleep onset time compared to self-reported sleep onset time; this effect was absent in the ARW group. Between-group differences in actigraphy-defined sleep onset time and significant between-group differences for actigraphy-defined and self-reported wake-up time were observed. HS group participants also presented significantly delayed actigraphy-defined wake-up time compared with selfreported wake-up time. No significant effect was found on total sleep time perception. Moreover, sleep/wake time misperception were found to be associated with daylight exposure and physical activity levels respectively. To the extent they are generalizable, these results suggest that lockdown restrictions can affect sleep onset and wake-up time perception but not total sleep time perception. Public health policy should consider such effects in the present pandemic situation and in future emergent public health situations.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine the association between sleep measurements by wrist actigraphy and patient self-report and assess the impact of physical activity and extrapulmonary symptoms on sleep quality in patients with fibrotic interstitial lung disease (ILD).
METHODS: Patients were recruited from specialized ILD clinics. Total sleep time, sleep efficiency, sleep latency and number of sleep disturbances were measured using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and an ActiGraph monitor worn on patients’ non-dominant wrist for seven consecutive days. Step counts were monitored over the same period using a waist monitor. Extrapulmonary symptoms were assessed with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and Brief Pain Inventory. Multivariable analyses were used to examine whether physical activity and extrapulmonary symptoms were determinants of sleep quality in fibrotic ILD.
RESULTS: A total of 111 patients were assessed (62\% male, mean age 70 ± 9 years). Mean selfreported total sleep time was 494 ± 80mins/night. Median self-reported sleep efficiency and latency were 97\% (94–98\%) and 15 min (8–30 min), respectively. Poor sleep quality was reported in 61\% of patients. Wrist monitors detected a mean total sleep time of 441 ± 72mins/night. Median sleep efficiency and latency measured by wrist monitors were 88\% (83–91\%) and 2 min (0–7 min), respectively. The PSQI was largely within limits of agreement in reference to the wrist monitor recordings. Higher pain severity was an independent predictor of reduced sleep efficiency, increased sleep latency and greater number of sleep disturbances measured by the PSQI on adjusted analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: The PSQI is generally in agreement with wrist actigraphy measurements. Pain is a determinant of sleep in fibrotic ILD.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To compare subjective sleep evaluation obtained using four questionnaires with polysomnography results for individuals with and without obstructive sleep apnea.
METHODS: Observational and analytical study in which individuals underwent polysomnography were studied retrospectively to investigate sleep disorders. We compared subjective data from a research database used to predict obstructive sleep apnea based on the STOP-BANG questionnaire, evaluation of excessive daytime sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale), sleep quality questionnaire (Mini Sleep Questionnaire) and Post-Sleep Data Collection Instrument with the self-reported total sleep time and sleep-onset latency for subjects with and without obstructive sleep apnea.
RESULTS: The STOP-BANG questionnaire was a good predictor for the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea. However, the other instruments did not show a signiﬁcant difference between healthy and sick individuals. Patients’ perceptions of their sleep onset time were signiﬁcantly lower than the polysomnographic data, but this difference remained for both subjects with and without obstructive sleep apnea. No difference was found between the subjective duration of sleep and the total sleep time assessed by polysomnography in either the healthy subjects or the patients.
CONCLUSION: Except for the STOP-BANG questionnaire, subjective evaluation of sleepiness, sleep quality, perception of onset, and total sleep time are not important parameters for the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea, which reinforces the need for an active search for better management of these patients.},

	abstract = {Objective: To explore the discrepancy between sleep diary and actigraphic measures of sleep in adolescents and to ascertain whether these discrepancies may vary according to characteristics of the participant.
Methods: Participants were 385 adolescents aged 13–18 years (X = 15.6, standard deviation [SD] = 0.95; 60\% male) from eight high schools in South Australia. Adolescents completed the School Sleep Habits Survey and Pediatric Daytime Sleepiness Scale during class time, followed by an 8-day sleep diary and wrist actigraphy. The Flinders Fatigue Scale was completed on the ﬁnal day of the study. Parents completed a sleep, medical, education, and family history survey.
Results: Actigraphic estimates of wake after sleep onset (WASO) were substantially greater than sleep diary estimates (74 min actigraphy vs. 7 min sleep diary) and actigraphic estimates of total sleep time were substantially less than sleep diary and parent report (6 h 51 min actigraphy vs. 8 h 16 min sleep diary vs. 8 h 51 parent report). Actigraphy displayed no signiﬁcant relationship with daytime functioning and weak relationships with concomitantly recorded sleep diary variables. Sex and puberty-related differences in actigraphic scoring were found, with more WASO and less sleep scored in boys compared to girls and more WASO scored amongst pubertally-mature boys than boys of less advanced pubertal development.
Conclusions: There may be differences in the sleep of adolescents that result in less actigraphic total sleep scored than perceived, particularly in boys, possibly because of increased sleep motor activity in adolescents that actigraphic algorithms score as wake. This is a signiﬁcant concern that requires further examination with polysomnography.},

	abstract = {Objectives: Objective sleep elements that underlie child ratings of sleep quality are largely unknown. Childbased sleep recommendations, therefore, typically focus on duration. An expert panel recently provided speciﬁc recommendations regarding objective sleep parameters that correspond with higher quality sleep, but child-based studies from which to draw conclusions were notably limited. The present study used actigraphy and polysomnography to explore sleep continuity and architectural variables that correspond with higher ratings of sleep quality in a sample of school-aged children.
Methods: Fifty-two healthy, prepubertal children (aged 7À11 years) completed one night of unattended ambulatory polysomnography at home with concurrent actigraphy and provided sleep quality ratings the following morning. Associations between sleep variables and subjective ratings were examined using polynomial regression models to examine potential linear and nonlinear relationships.
Results: In contrast to ﬁndings among adults, total sleep time, sleep onset latency, and sleep efﬁciency values were unrelated to child ratings of sleep quality. Wake after sleep onset (WASO) showed a curvilinear (reversed j-shaped) relationship such that perceptions of sleep quality were high when WASO values were less than approximately 30 minutes. For sleep architecture, N1\% showed a signiﬁcant quadratic association with sleep quality such that N1\% between 2\% and 6\% corresponded with high sleep quality ratings.
Conclusions: Our ﬁndings support expert recommendations regarding WASO values that predict high quality sleep in children, but also await replication. There is need for additional research aimed at understanding objective sleep elements and other inﬂuences of children’s perceptions of sleep quality using linear and nonlinear models.},

Insomnia participants underwent two full-night polysomnographic (PSG) recording, followed by a morning assessment of subjective sleep parameters. A misperception index (MI) was computed in order to identify participants characterized by objective insomnia and non-objective insomnia. The EF performance associations between insomnia and poor performance on selected executive functions was confirmed. However, the objective insomnia and non-objective insomnia sub-groups show significant differences on specific EF indices, as well as on dysfunctional personality dimensions.},

This study examines the dynamic within-person relationships between subjective (Ecological Momentary Assessment) and objective sleep (actigraphy) on next-day cognition (subjective and objective), mood, and engagement in daily activities using linear mixed-effects regression modeling. Participants included 94 individuals (59 people with HIV, 35 HIV-) aged 50–74, assessed daily for 14 consecutive days/nights. Subjective and objective sleep were well correlated and were both associated with subjective ratings of cognition, but not objective cognition. Worse subjective sleep was associated with next-day lower happiness and higher depressed mood, and more pain, but was not related to next-day daily activities. Objective sleep was associated with next-day depressed mood and feelings of worry, and was positively associated with next-day television watching. Results provide evidence to support the utility of real-time assessment for sleep and functional outcomes that may lead to potential personalized interventions for individuals with and without HIV.},

Reliable and valid for adult participants, it offers advantages over existing methodologies in cost and convenience.

Sixty-ﬁve children (20 boys, 45 girls), aged 11–16 years participated in this study. The participants wore wrist actigraphs, completed a 1-week sleep diary and the STQ. Analyses tested convergent validity between the STQ and actigraphy, and the STQ and sleep diaries. Correlations between STQ and actigraphy (r = 0.45–0.76, P {\textless} 0.001), and STQ and sleep diaries (r = 0.42–0.86, P {\textless} 0.001), were positive and signiﬁcant for sleep onset and wake times. Correlations between STQ and actigraphy for sleep latency and wake after sleep onset (WASO) were very low (r {\textless} 0.10). In contrast, sleep latency was moderately and signiﬁcantly correlated between STQ and sleep diary (r = 0.42, P {\textless} 0.001), and the correlation for WASO was high and signiﬁcant (r = 0.74, P {\textless} 0.001). Differences between the STQ and sleep diary were within acceptable limits for all sleep parameters, and the differences between STQ and actigraphy were acceptable for sleep onset and school day wake time. The STQ may be a valid indicator of sleep onset and wake time in school-age children. It can also produce measures of sleep latency and WASO with comparable accuracy to a standard sleep diary.},

Linear regression models provided estimates of concordance between actigraphy-based and self-reported sleep duration.
Results:  Among 821 adults, self-assessed average sleep duration was lower than self-assessed wake-bed time differences (6.4 ± 1.4 vs. 7.5 ± 1.7 h, p {\textless} 0.0001). Mean actigraphy-based TST was 6.6 ± 1.2 h, and actigraphy-based average TIB was 7.6 ± 1.2 h. Self-assessed average sleep duration and actigraphy-based TST were moderately correlated (r = 0.28, p {\textless} 0.0001). Self-assessed average sleep duration underestimated actigraphy-based TST by −30.7 min (95\% confidence intervals [CI]: −36.5 to −24.9). In contrast, self-assessed wake-bed time differences overestimated actigraphy-based TST by 45.1 min (95\% CI: 38.6–51.5). In subgroup analyses, self-assessed average sleep duration underestimated actigraphy-based measures most strongly among participants with insomnia symptoms.
Conclusions:  Among African Americans, self-assessed average sleep duration underestimated objectively measured sleep while self-assessed wake-bed time differences overestimated objectively measured sleep. Sleep measurement property differences should be considered when investigating disparities in sleep and evaluating their associations with health outcomes.},

	abstract = {Although individuals diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) regularly report subjective sleep disruption, many studies using objective measures (e.g., polysomnography) report no PTSD-related sleep disruption. To account for these inconsistencies, some authors hypothesize that PTSD-diagnosed individuals have sleep-state misperception; that is, they self-report experiencing poor sleep quality, but objectively sleep relatively normally. We tested this sleep-state misperception hypothesis, collecting data on subjectively-reported sleep quality (in the home, and in the laboratory) and on objectively-measured, laboratory-based, sleep quality in PTSDdiagnosed participants from low socioeconomic status South African communities. Women with PTSD (n = 21), with trauma exposure but no PTSD (TE; n = 19), and healthy controls (HC; n = 20) completed questionnaires on their average sleep quality in the past 30 days, and on their sleep quality after a night (8 h) of polysomnographicmonitored sleep in the laboratory. PTSD-diagnosed individuals reported poorer everyday subjective sleep quality than TE and HC individuals. In the laboratory, however, there were no between-group differences in subjective sleep quality, and few between-group differences in objective sleep quality (PTSD-diagnosed individuals only had decreased sleep depth). Furthermore, whereas measures of laboratory-based objective and subjective sleep quality correlated signiﬁcantly, especially in PTSD-diagnosed individuals, there were few signiﬁcant associations between objective sleep measures and everyday subjective sleep quality. Taken together, these ﬁndings suggest that PTSD-diagnosed individuals likely experienced better sleep quality in the laboratory than at home. Descriptive observations corroborated this interpretation, with almost half the sample rating their laboratory sleep (which they described as “safe” and “quiet”) as better than their home sleep (which was experienced in an atmosphere marked by high levels of violence and nighttime noise). These ﬁndings disconﬁrm the sleep-state misperception hypothesis as related to PTSD, and suggest that the laboratory environment may inﬂuence sleep quality positively in these individuals. Many investigations of sleep in PTSD do not consider the inﬂuence of the laboratory environment. Our ﬁndings suggest that future studies in this ﬁeld should consider that sleep-state misperception may be an artifact of the laboratory setting, especially when samples are drawn from communities where violence and crime are an everyday reality.},

We evaluated associations of select factors (demographics; medical, physical, and neuropsychiatric conditions; medication and substance use; and sleep-related measures) with risk of false-negative (normal sleep duration by self-report but short sleep duration by actigraphy) and false-positive (short sleep duration by self-report and normal sleep duration by actigraphy) designations, respectively, using logistic regression.
Results: Average ages were 76.3 ± 5.5 and 83.5 ± 3.7 years in men and women, respectively. There was poor agreement between self-reported and actigraphic sleep duration (kappa ≤ 0.24). False negatives occurred in nearly half and false positives in over a quarter of older persons. In multivariable models in men and women, false negatives were independently associated with obesity, daytime sleepiness, and napping, while false positives were significantly lower with obesity.
Conclusions: Under- and overreporting of short sleep is common among older persons. Reliance on self-report may lead to missed opportunities to prevent adverse outcomes or unnecessary interventions. Self-reported sleep duration should be objectively confirmed when evaluating the effect of sleep duration on health outcomes.},

Method: 63 adolescents (mean= 15.8±2.2 yrs, 63.5\% f) diagnosed with DSWPD and 40 good sleeping adolescents (mean= 15.9±2.4 yrs, 75\% f) completed baseline measures of sleep, daytime functioning and cognitive “insomnia” processes (i.e., repetitive negative thinking, physiological hyperarousal, distress, sleep-related attention and monitoring, sleep misperception). 60 DSWPD adolescents (mean= 15.9±2.2 y, 63\% f) entered a treatment trial and received three weeks of light therapy. Sleep, daytime functioning and insomnia were measured again post-treatment and at 3 month follow-up.
Results: Adolescents with DSWPD had significantly later sleep timing (d=0.99-1.50), longer sleep latency (d=1.14) and shorter total sleep time (d=0.85) on school nights, compared to the good sleeping adolescents. There was evidence of cognitive “insomnia” symptoms, with the DSWPD group reporting more repetitive negative thinking (d=0.70-1.02), trait hyperarousal (d=0.55), distress (d=2.19), sleep associated monitoring (d=0.76) and sleep onset misperception (d=1.29). Across treatment and follow-up, adolescents with DSWPD reported advanced sleep timing (d=0.54-0.62), reduced sleep latency (d=0.53), increased total sleep time (d=0.49) and improved daytime functioning (d=0.46-1.00). Repetitive negative thinking (d=0.64-0.96), physiological arousal (d=0.69), distress (d=0.87), and sleep onset misperception (d=0.37) also showed improvement.
Conclusions: Cognitive “insomnia” processes may be implicated in the development and maintenance of DSWPD in adolescents. Many of these processes are amendable to chronobiological treatment; however residual symptoms may place adolescents at risk of poor treatment outcome or relapse.},

Results:  The PTSD group reported lower sleep quality, more nights with nightmares, and shorter sleep duration than both HTC and HC. Actigraphic measures showed more and longer sleep interruptions in the PTSD group compared to HTC and HC, but no difference in sleep duration. While the PTSD group underestimated their sleep duration, both HTC and HC overestimated their sleep duration. HTC did not differ from HC regarding sleep impairments.
Conclusions:  Sleep in women with PTSD after CA seems to be more fragmented but not shorter compared to sleep patterns of mentally healthy control subjects.

Based on the misperception index (MI), participants were classified into NSSM (MI {\textgreater} 0, n = 115) and PSSM (MI {\textless} 0, n = 35) groups.
Results: The PSSM group had more N3 sleep on nocturnal polysomnography than the NSSM group (P = .002). The NSSM group showed a higher PSQI score (P {\textless} .001), longer self-reported sleep-onset latency (SOL) (P = .001), and a greater SOL discrepancy (P = .001). Self-reported feelings of tiredness and morning awakenings in the morning were higher in the NSSM group (P = .029 and P = .038). The MI negatively correlated with a proportion of N3 sleep (P = .005) and positively correlated with PSQI (P {\textless} .001), morning awakenings (P = .01), self-reported SOL (P {\textless} .001), and SOL discrepancy (P {\textless} .001) in patients with insomnia. Multiple regression analysis showed that N3 sleep, PSQI, and morning awakenings were significantly associated with MI in patients with insomnia.
Conclusions: The proportion of slow-wave sleep and self-reported measures may be associated with perception of sleep in patients with insomnia. Objective and self-reported characteristics of patients with insomnia should be carefully evaluated and managed because they may influence the perception of sleep.},

In order to clarify this issue, we calculated subjective-objective difference (SOD), using diary estimates of sleep period time (SPT) minus actigraphically measured total sleep time (TST), and investigated the relationship between SOD and descriptive measures, including the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Participants of the present study consisted of 50 persons having subjective insomnia (mean age: 46.6 ± 11.9 years; 33 males, 17 females). All the participants were divided into three groups based on SOD values (positive group, intermediate group, and negative group). The negative group showed significantly worse PSQI scores for C1 (sleep quality), C2 (sleep onset latency), C4 (sleep efficiency), and C6 (use of sleep medications), compared to the other two groups, whereas no significant difference was found in C7 (daytime dysfunction) among the three groups. The results of the present study indicate that a negative value of SOD, a measure for evaluating the severity of paradoxical insomnia, increases along with aggravation of subjective sleep disturbance among insomniacs.},
